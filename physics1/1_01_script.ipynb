    "# 1.1. Kinematics in one dimension\n",
    "Kinematics describes how objects move without explaining why they move. In one dimension, motion unfolds along a single straight line—usually the horizontal $x$-axis or vertical $y$-axis—and is expressed through quantities like position, displacement, velocity, and acceleration. To describe motion unambiguously, we must define a reference frame, specifying an origin, a time scale, and which direction counts as positive.\n"

    "## 1.1.1. Frame of reference\n",
    "A reference frame is the stage on which motion takes place. It consists of an observer, an origin, coordinate axes, and a clock. **All measurements of position, velocity, and acceleration are made relative to that frame**. For instance, a passenger walking inside a moving train may be nearly at rest relative to the train but moving rapidly relative to the ground—both descriptions are correct within their respective frames. In everyday (Galilean) mechanics, transforming between frames involves simply adding or subtracting velocities depending on direction. **Although numerical values may differ, all observers agree on the physical events themselves**, such as when the passenger reaches the door. Stating the reference frame and axis convention at the outset prevents sign errors and ensures consistent interpretation of motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1.2. Velocity as a vector (in 1D)  \n",
    "Velocity $v$ is fundamentally a **vector** quantity. In one dimension, its direction reduces to a sign, but it can still be useful to write $\\vec v = v\\,\\hat\\imath$ (horizontal) or $\\vec v = v\\,\\hat\\jmath$ (vertical). This notation keeps direction explicit and makes relationships like “$\\vec a$ is opposite to $\\vec v$” precise.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It also reminds us that coordinate conventions (e.g. moving the origin or flipping the positive direction) must be applied consistently to position, velocity, and acceleration together. **The physics does not change when coordinates do, only the algebraic signs change**.\n",

    "\n",
    "It uses **displacement**, the signed change in position, not the total path length. Because of this, direction reversals can make $\\bar{v}$ small or even zero, even when the traveled distance is large. On a position–time graph, $\\bar{v}$ equals the slope of the **secant line** connecting $(t_0, x_0)$ and $(t, x)$. A straight line indicates constant velocity, while curvature means that velocity changes over time. \n",

    "## 1.1.9 Freely falling objects  \n",
    "Near Earth’s surface and neglecting air resistance, all objects accelerate downward with the same magnitude $g \\approx 9.81\\,\\text{m/s}^2.$\n",
    "You may choose “up” as positive so that $a = -g$, or “down” as positive so that $a = +g$—either convention is valid if applied consistently. \n",
    "This **universality of free fall** is remarkable: in a vacuum, light and heavy bodies share the same acceleration. Historically, this principle became visible through early vacuum experiments, such as Otto von Guericke’s demonstrations showing the dramatic effects of removing air.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In our one-dimensional framework, free fall is simply a case of **uniformly accelerated motion** with $a = \\pm g$, where we use $y$ instead of $x$ to represent vertical position. The familiar equations apply:\n",
    "$$v(t) = v_0 \\pm gt, \\qquad y(t) = y_0 + v_0t \\pm \\tfrac{1}{2}gt^2.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming $v_0 = 0\\,\\text{m/s}$, the equations further simplify to:\n",
    "$$v(t) = \\pm gt, \\qquad y(t) = \\pm \\tfrac{1}{2}gt^2.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Two practical notes refine this idealization without breaking it. First, $g$ varies slightly with latitude and altitude, but the standard value is sufficient for most calculations. Second, **air resistance** increases with speed and cross-section; over long drops or for light objects it eventually balances gravity, leading to a **terminal velocity** where acceleration effectively vanishes. \n",
