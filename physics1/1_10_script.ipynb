    "\n",
    "In this chapter we introduce **wave motion** as the propagation of **oscillations through space and time**. We begin by defining the **types and basic characteristics of waves** and develop their **mathematical description** using traveling wave functions and the **wave equation**. We then study how waves **transport energy**, how they behave at **boundaries** through reflection and transmission, and how **superposition** leads to interference and standing waves. The chapter concludes with **refraction, dispersion, and diffraction**, highlighting the universal principles that govern wave phenomena across mechanics, acoustics, and optics.\n",

    "## 1.10.1 Characteristics of Waves\n",
    "\n",
    "A **wave** is a disturbance that travels through space and time, transferring **energy** and **momentum** without transporting matter. Typical examples include water waves, sound waves, seismic waves, and electromagnetic waves. All waves share common properties such as amplitude, wavelength, frequency, period, and speed, which together describe how the disturbance evolves and propagates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Nature of Waves\n",
    "\n",
    "When energy is imparted to a medium, its particles are displaced from their equilibrium positions. These particles exert restoring forces on neighboring particles, thereby transmitting the disturbance through the medium. Wave motion is therefore the propagation of energy through oscillations of the medium’s particles. Each particle oscillates about its equilibrium position, but there is **no net transport of matter**, and only the disturbance itself propagates through the medium.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mechanical, Electromagnetic, and Matter Waves\n",
    "\n",
    "Mechanical waves require a material medium for their propagation, such as water, air, or solids, and examples include sound waves, water waves, and waves on strings. Their behavior depends on the **elastic** and **inertial** properties of the medium. Electromagnetic waves do not require a material medium and can propagate through vacuum, with examples including light, radio waves, and X-rays. They arise from oscillating electric and magnetic fields that sustain each other during propagation. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Terms in Wave Motion\n",
    "\n",
    "The **medium** is the substance through which the wave travels, while the **source** is the origin of the disturbance, such as a vibrating object. **Propagation** refers to the transfer of energy through oscillations of particles or variations of fields. The **direction of propagation** is the direction in which energy is transported. A **wavefront** is a surface connecting points that oscillate in the same phase and is useful for visualizing how waves spread through space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Characteristics of a Wave\n",
    "\n",
    "The **amplitude** $A$ is the maximum displacement of particles of the medium from their equilibrium position and is a measure of the wave’s energy content, with larger amplitudes corresponding to greater energy. The **wavelength** $\\lambda$ is the distance between two consecutive points that are in the same phase of motion, such as two neighboring crests or compressions. The **frequency** $f$ is the number of complete oscillations per second and is measured in hertz, while the **period** $T$ is the time required for one complete oscillation and is related to the frequency by\n",
    "$$\n",
    "T = \\frac{1}{f}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The **wave speed** $v$ describes how fast the disturbance propagates through the medium and is given by\n",
    "$$\n",
    "v = f\\lambda = \\frac{\\lambda}{T}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conceptual Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "Waves transmit **energy rather than matter**, and their form and motion depend on both the **properties of the medium** and the **frequency of the source**. The frequency of a wave is determined by the source and does not change when the wave enters a different medium. The wave speed depends on the medium’s **elasticity** and **inertia**, and the wavelength adjusts as necessary so that the relation\n",

    "## 1.10.2 Types of Waves\n",
    "\n",
    "Waves can be classified according to the **direction of particle motion** relative to the direction of wave propagation. This distinction defines the two principal types of mechanical waves, namely **transverse** and **longitudinal** waves. \n",
    "\n",
    "Independently of particle motion, waves can also be classified by the **geometry of their wavefronts**, leading to **plane waves** and **spherical waves**, which describe how energy is distributed and propagates in space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transverse Waves\n",
    "\n",
    "In a **transverse wave**, the particles of the medium oscillate **perpendicular** to the direction in which the wave propagates. The disturbance travels along the medium, while individual particles move about their equilibrium positions in a direction orthogonal to propagation. Typical examples include waves on a stretched string or rope, ripples on the surface of water, and electromagnetic waves, although electromagnetic waves are not mechanical waves. Points of maximum positive displacement are called **crests**, while points of maximum negative displacement are called **troughs**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Longitudinal Waves\n",
    "\n",
    "In a **longitudinal wave**, the particles of the medium oscillate **parallel** to the direction of wave propagation. Instead of crests and troughs, the wave consists of alternating regions of **compression**, where density and pressure are higher than average, and **rarefaction**, where they are lower. These regions move through the medium as the wave propagates. Common examples include sound waves in air, compression waves in springs or slinkies, and seismic primary waves, also known as P-waves.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plane Waves and Spherical Waves\n",
    "\n",
    "Waves can also be classified by the **geometry of their wavefronts**. A **plane wave** has wavefronts that are parallel planes, meaning that the disturbance propagates in a single direction with uniform amplitude and phase across each wavefront. Plane waves are a good approximation for waves far from their source or in confined systems such as waves on a long string. A **spherical wave** originates from a **point source** and has wavefronts that are concentric spheres expanding outward. In spherical waves, the energy spreads over an increasing area, so the amplitude decreases with distance from the source, even though the frequency remains constant.\n",

    "To describe wave motion quantitatively, we consider a one-dimensional wave propagating along the x-axis, which may be transverse, as on a stretched string, or longitudinal, as in a solid rod or fluid-filled tube.

At a fixed time, the function $D(x,t)$ describes the **spatial shape** of the wave, which is sinusoidal and translates along the x-axis without changing form. At a fixed position, the displacement varies **sinusoidally in time**, so that each particle undergoes simple harmonic motion with angular frequency $\\omega$. Particles with the same phase oscillate in sync, while a phase difference $\\Delta\\phi$ indicates how far their oscillations are shifted relative to one another.\n",

    "### Standing Waves from Superposition of Opposite Waves\n",
    "\n",
    "A **standing wave** is a special interference pattern formed when two waves of the same frequency and amplitude travel in **opposite directions** through the same medium. This situation commonly arises due to reflection at boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "For two such waves,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y_1(x,t) = A \\sin(kx - \\omega t), \\qquad\n",
    "y_2(x,t) = A \\sin(kx + \\omega t).\n",

    "Using the trigonometric identity\n",
    "$\\sin\\alpha + \\sin\\beta = 2\\sin\\!\\bigl(\\tfrac{\\alpha+\\beta}{2}\\bigr)\\cos\\!\\bigl(\\tfrac{\\alpha-\\beta}{2}\\bigr)$,\n",
    "their superposition is (with $\\alpha = kx - \\omega t$ and $\\beta = kx + \\omega t$ and $\\cos(-\\omega t)=\\cos(\\omega t)$)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y(x,t) = 2A \\sin(kx)\\cos(\\omega t).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "This expression represents a standing wave. The factor $\\sin(kx)$ determines the fixed spatial pattern of the wave, while $\\cos(\\omega t)$ describes the temporal oscillation, which has the same frequency at every point along the medium.\n",
    "\n",
    "Points where $\\sin(kx)=0$ are **nodes**, where the displacement is always zero and occur at\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x_n = n\\frac{\\lambda}{2}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Points where $|\\sin(kx)|=1$ are **antinodes**, where the displacement amplitude is maximal. Adjacent nodes or antinodes are separated by half a wavelength.\n",

    "Thus, every point of the medium executes simple harmonic motion with the same angular frequency $\\omega$, but with an amplitude that varies from zero at nodes to a maximum at antinodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Energy in Standing Waves\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike traveling waves, standing waves do **not** transport energy along the medium. Instead, energy oscillates locally between kinetic and potential forms. At nodes, the displacement and kinetic energy are always zero, while potential energy is maximal; energy oscillates locally but does not propagate. At antinodes the energy alternates between maximum kinetic and maximum potential values as the medium oscillates in time.\n",

    "### Standing Waves on a String and Resonance\n",
    "\n",

    "$$\n",
    "These discrete frequencies are the **natural frequencies** or **harmonics** of the string. Each allowed standing-wave pattern is called a **mode of vibration**. The lowest-frequency mode is the **fundamental**, while higher modes are overtones.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Resonance** occurs when a system is driven by an external periodic force whose frequency matches one of its natural frequencies. Under this condition, energy transfer is highly efficient and the amplitude of oscillation increases significantly. In real systems, the amplitude is ultimately limited by damping and energy losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a standing wave, kinetic energy is largest near nodes where the displacement changes most rapidly, while potential energy is largest near antinodes where the displacement is greatest. While resonance is essential for sound production and signal amplification, excessive resonance can lead to structural damage if oscillations grow too large.\n",

    "### Conceptual Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "Superposition is a direct consequence of the linearity of the wave equation and governs interference, standing waves, and resonance. Interference redistributes energy spatially without loss, while standing waves result from the superposition of oppositely traveling waves and involve no net energy transport. Resonance occurs when a system is driven at one of its natural frequencies, leading to large oscillation amplitudes. \n"

    "## 1.10.8 Wave Speed Variations: Refraction and Dispersion\n",
    "\n",
    "Wave propagation is fundamentally controlled by the **wave speed** $v$, which is determined by the physical properties of the medium. When the wave speed varies, either because the wave enters a different medium or because different frequency components travel at different speeds, the observable behavior of the wave changes. Two central phenomena arise from this dependence: **refraction**, which results from spatial changes in wave speed, and **dispersion**, which results from frequency-dependent wave speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dispersion\n",
    "\n",
    "In a **dispersive medium**, the wave speed depends on frequency. As a result, different sinusoidal components of a composite wave propagate with different speeds. Since any realistic waveform can be decomposed into sinusoidal components by Fourier analysis, dispersion causes the overall shape of a wave packet or pulse to change as it travels through the medium. In contrast, in a **non-dispersive medium**, the wave speed is independent of frequency, so all components propagate together and the waveform maintains its shape during propagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dispersion is therefore a property of the medium rather than of a specific waveform. It plays a central role in pulse broadening, signal distortion, and the spreading of wave packets, and it becomes especially important when waves contain a wide range of frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Refraction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Refraction** is the change in direction and speed of a wave as it passes obliquely from one medium into another in which the wave velocity is different. During refraction, the **frequency of the wave remains constant**, because it is determined by the source. However, the **wave speed** and therefore the **wavelength** change, leading to a change in the direction of propagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Refraction occurs for all types of waves, including water waves, sound waves, seismic waves, and electromagnetic waves such as light. The phenomenon is a direct consequence of spatial variations in wave speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wavefront Interpretation of Refraction\n",
    "\n",
    "Refraction can be understood most clearly using wavefronts. When a wavefront crosses a boundary at an angle, different parts of the wavefront enter the new medium at different times. If the wave speed changes across the boundary, the portion that enters first changes speed while the remainder continues at the original speed. This difference causes the wavefront to rotate, producing a change in the direction of propagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In regions where the wave speed is lower, wavefronts are closer together, corresponding to a shorter wavelength. In regions where the wave speed is higher, wavefronts are more widely spaced. The bending of the wave is therefore a geometric consequence of unequal wavefront spacing across the boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Law of Refraction for Waves\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a wave incident on a boundary between two media at an angle $\\theta_1$ relative to the normal and refracted into the second medium at an angle $\\theta_2$. If the wave speeds in the two media are $v_1$ and $v_2$, the angles are related by\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\sin\\theta_1}{\\sin\\theta_2} = \\frac{v_1}{v_2}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "If the wave slows down upon entering the second medium, so that $v_2 < v_1$, the refracted wave bends **toward the normal**. If the wave speeds up, it bends **away from the normal**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Change of Wavelength at a Boundary\n",
    "\n",
    "Because wave speed, frequency, and wavelength are related by $v = f\\lambda$, and because the frequency remains unchanged during refraction, the wavelengths in the two media satisfy\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\lambda_1}{\\lambda_2} = \\frac{v_1}{v_2}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A decrease in wave speed therefore leads to a shorter wavelength, while an increase in wave speed leads to a longer wavelength. The change in wavelength is directly responsible for the change in propagation direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unified View: Refraction and Dispersion\n",
    "\n",
    "Refraction and dispersion arise from the same physical cause: **variations in wave speed**. In refraction, the wave speed varies **in space**, leading to changes in wavelength and propagation direction. In dispersion, the wave speed varies **with frequency**, causing different spectral components to separate and the waveform to change shape. Together, these phenomena illustrate how the properties of a medium govern both the geometry and the evolution of wave motion.\n",

    "## 1.10.9 Diffraction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Diffraction** is the spreading or bending of waves when they encounter an obstacle, slit, or aperture whose size is comparable to the wavelength. It is a defining property of wave motion and allows waves to propagate into regions that would otherwise lie in geometric shadow, explaining many everyday and scientific observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nature of Diffraction\n",
    "\n",
    "When a wavefront passes through an opening or around an obstacle, each point on the wavefront acts as a source of new waves, leading to a redistribution of energy beyond the obstacle or aperture. The extent of diffraction depends on the ratio between the wavelength and the characteristic size of the opening. If the opening is much larger than the wavelength, diffraction is weak and the wave travels almost in straight lines. If the opening is comparable to the wavelength, diffraction becomes pronounced and the wave spreads significantly. If the opening is smaller than the wavelength, the emerging wave resembles a nearly spherical wave.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Huygens’ Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "Huygens’ principle states that every point on a wavefront can be regarded as a source of secondary spherical wavelets that propagate outward with the same speed as the wave itself. The new wavefront at a later time is formed by the envelope of these secondary wavelets. This principle provides a unified qualitative explanation of reflection, refraction, interference, and diffraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Diffraction Through a Single Slit\n",
    "\n",
    "When a plane wave of wavelength $\\lambda$ is incident on a slit of width $a$, each point within the slit acts as a source of secondary wavelets that interfere with one another in the region beyond the slit. The resulting interference pattern consists of a central bright maximum flanked by alternating dark and bright regions. The condition for destructive interference, corresponding to dark minima in the diffraction pattern, is\n",
    "$$\n",
    "a \\sin\\theta = m\\lambda, \\quad m = \\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm3, \\dots\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\theta$ is the angle measured from the central axis. The central maximum is the brightest feature and is wider than the secondary maxima, whose intensity decreases with increasing angle.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Diffraction by an Obstacle or Edge\n",
    "\n",
    "Diffraction also occurs when waves encounter an obstacle or a sharp edge. The portions of the wavefront that are not blocked act as secondary sources, producing wave propagation into the region behind the obstacle. This explains why water waves spread behind barriers, why sound can be heard around corners, and why light can bend slightly around small apertures under suitable conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Diffraction Through Multiple Slits\n",
    "\n",
    "When waves pass through multiple equally spaced slits, forming a diffraction grating, the superposition of waves from all slits produces sharp and well-defined maxima. The condition for constructive interference in a grating is\n",
    "$$\n",
    "d \\sin\\theta = m\\lambda, \\quad m = 0, \\pm1, \\pm2, \\dots\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $d$ is the spacing between adjacent slits. Diffraction gratings are widely used because they produce narrow peaks that allow precise wavelength measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications and Everyday Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Diffraction plays a central role in optical spectroscopy, acoustic engineering, radio-wave transmission, microscopy, astronomy, and X-ray crystallography. In everyday life, diffraction explains why sound can be heard through doorways, why shadows have fuzzy edges, why compact discs display colorful patterns, and why light spreads after passing through narrow slits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conceptual Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "Diffraction occurs whenever waves encounter edges, apertures, or obstacles comparable in size to their wavelength. The amount of spreading increases for larger wavelengths and smaller openings. Single-slit diffraction produces a broad central maximum accompanied by weaker side maxima. Diffraction and interference are complementary manifestations of wave superposition, and diffraction ultimately limits the resolving power of optical instruments. More details follow in the next semester/Physics II.\n"
