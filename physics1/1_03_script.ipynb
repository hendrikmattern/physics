    "## 1.3.1. Force\n",
    "A force is any interaction capable of changing an object’s motion—e.g. experienced as a push or a pull. Forces may involve physical contact (pushing a door, friction, normal force, tension) or act at a distance (gravity, electromagnetism). A stationary object requires a force to start moving, and a moving object requires a force to change its velocity in magnitude or direction—that is, to accelerate. The magnitude of a force can be measured with a spring scale, which relies on the proportional stretch of a calibrated spring. Because forces have both magnitude and direction, they are **vectors** and combine by vector addition; the **net force** (resultant) is the vector sum of all forces acting on an object and is what determines its acceleration."

    "## 1.3.2. Newton’s first law of motion: The law of inertia\n",
    "\n",
    "Early thinkers such as Aristotle believed that a force was needed to keep an object moving; in their view, rest was the \"natural\" state, and motion required continuous pushing or pulling. However, Galileo challenged this idea by imagining motion on a perfectly smooth surface with no friction. He realized that as friction is reduced, less and less force is needed to maintain constant motion. In the ideal limit of zero friction, no force at all is needed to keep an object moving at constant speed in a straight line.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this reasoning, Galileo concluded that an object will continue moving with constant velocity unless a force acts to change that state of motion. He further recognized that friction is simply another real force that resists motion, rather than proof that continuous effort is needed to maintain motion. This was a revolutionary insight: forces are required not to keep things moving, but to change their motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building on Galileo’s work, Newton formulated his **first law of motion**:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Every object continues in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by a net external force.\n",
    "\n",
    "This property of matter, the tendency to resist changes in motion, is called **inertia**, and the law is therefore also known as the **Law of Inertia**. A body will remain at rest or continue to move at constant velocity unless the vector sum of all forces acting on it (the **net force**) is nonzero. If the forces on an object balance each other so that the net force is zero, its velocity remains constant, including the special case of remaining at rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a puck gliding on an air table moves almost without friction and will continue in a straight line at constant speed. Similarly, a school bus that suddenly stops causes backpacks to slide forward, not because a forward force acts on them, but because they maintain their previous motion until a force (friction with the floor) slows them down.\n",

    "## 1.3.3. Inertial reference frames \\& when the first law holds\n",
    "\n",
    "Newton’s first law is not valid in all reference frames. If you observe motion from an accelerating frame, such as a car speeding up, slowing down, or turning, objects appear to move even though no physical force acts on them. A smartphone sliding backward on the dashboard of a car that accelerates forward does so because it tends to remain at rest while the car moves ahead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reference frames in which Newton’s first law holds are called **inertial reference frames**. In these frames, an object not acted upon by a net force moves with constant velocity. Reference frames that accelerate or rotate relative to an inertial frame are **non-inertial**, and within them, apparent motions can occur that cannot be explained by real forces.\n",
    "\n",
    "For most everyday purposes, we can treat the **Earth** as an approximately inertial reference frame. Although the Earth rotates and revolves around the Sun, these accelerations are small enough that their effects on most laboratory or classroom experiments can be neglected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any frame moving with **constant velocity** relative to an inertial frame (for instance, a smoothly moving car or airplane) is itself inertial. Newton’s first law therefore provides both a description of motion and a **definition of inertial frames**: a frame is inertial if, and only if, an object free of forces moves in a straight line at constant speed.\n",

    "## 1.3.4. Mass \\& Inertia\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mass** quantifies an object’s inertia, its resistance to acceleration or change in motion. It measures how strongly an object resists being accelerated by a given force. The larger the mass, the greater the force required to produce the same change in velocity. A heavy truck, for example, needs much more force than a bicycle to achieve the same acceleration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mass is an intrinsic property of matter and does not depend on location. It is measured in **kilograms (kg)**, the SI unit of mass. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Weight**, in contrast, is a **force**—the gravitational pull on a mass:  \n",
    "$\\vec W = m\\vec g$, directed toward Earth’s center, with $|\\vec g| \\approx 9.81\\,\\text{m/s}^2$ near the surface.  \n",
    "\n",
    "An object’s mass remains the same everywhere, but its weight changes with the local gravitational field. On the Moon, where gravity is weaker, an object weighs only about one-sixth as much as on Earth but has the same mass and inertia. This distinction clarifies that gravity provides one particular force acting on mass, while mass itself expresses resistance to *any* change in motion.\n"

    "## 1.3.5. Newton’s second law of motion\n",
    "\n",
    "Newton’s first law describes what happens when no net force acts on an object. The **second law** explains what occurs when a net force *is* present: an object’s velocity changes, meaning it accelerates. If the net force acts in the same direction as motion, the object speeds up; if it acts in the opposite direction, it slows down; and if it acts sideways, it changes direction. In all cases, a net force causes acceleration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Newton’s **second law of motion** is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "> At any instant of time, the net force on a body is equal to the body's acceleration multiplied by its mass or, equivalently, the rate at which the body's momentum is changing with time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass.  \n",
    "Further, the direction of the acceleration is the same as that of the net force.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In vector form, the law can be stated as\n",
    "$\\vec F_{\\text{net}} = m \\vec a$  \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the net force is the vector sum of all individual forces,  \n",
    "$\\vec F_{\\text{net}} = \\sum_i \\vec F_i$.\n",

    "## 1.3.6. Newton’s third law of motion\n",
    "\n",
    "Newton’s second law describes how a force changes motion, but it does not explain **where forces come from**. Observation shows that forces always arise from **interactions between two objects**: a hammer pushes on a nail, a hand presses on a desk, a rocket pushes on exhaust gases. In every such interaction, **both objects exert forces on each other**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Newton’s **third law of motion** states:\n",
    "> If two bodies exert forces on each other, these forces have the same magnitude but opposite directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, whenever one object exerts a force on a second object, the second object exerts an equal force in the opposite direction on the first. This principle is sometimes summarized as: **To every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In symbolic form:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\vec F_{AB} = -\\vec F_{BA},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\vec F_{AB}$ is the force exerted on object B by object A, and $\\vec F_{BA}$ is the force exerted on object A by object B.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it may seem trivial that the two forces are **equal in magnitude** and **opposite in direction**, there is a small, but **crucial point** to keep in mind when applying the third law: Force $F_{AB}$ is exerted by object $A$ on object $B$ and force $F_{BA}$ is exerted by object $B$ on object $A$. Thus, **the two forces act on different bodies**. They therefore never cancel within a single free-body diagram (see later).  \n",
    "\n",
    "To better illustrate this point, let's look at some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1: Ice Skater \\& wall\n",
    "\n",
    "An ice skater pushes backward against the wall of a rink. Because friction with the ice is minimal, she moves backward freely. The force she exerts on the wall acts **on the wall**, not on herself. Her own acceleration results from the **reaction force**: the wall pushing forward on her with equal magnitude and opposite direction. Thus, the skater moves because of the force exerted *by the wall on her*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2: Walking \\& propulsion\n",
    "\n",
    "Walking also illustrates the third law. When you step, your foot pushes **backward** against the ground. In response, the ground pushes **forward** on your foot with equal magnitude. It is this forward reaction force from the ground that propels you ahead.  \n",
    "Without friction (for example, on smooth ice), your foot cannot push effectively, and you cannot walk normally.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same reasoning explains **rocket propulsion**: a rocket engine pushes hot gases backward, and the gases push the rocket forward. The rocket accelerates because of the force **on it** exerted by the escaping gases, not because the gases “push against the air or the ground.”\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 3: Different masses, equal corces\n",
    "\n",
    "Equal and opposite forces do not imply equal accelerations. According to the second law, acceleration depends on both force and mass ($a = F/m$). When a rocket expels gas, the gas (small mass) gains large acceleration, while the rocket (large mass) gains smaller acceleration in the opposite direction. The forces are equal, but their effects differ.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 4: Clarifying action \\& reaction\n",
    "\n",
    "It is essential to distinguish **which object** each force acts on and **which object** exerts it.  \n",
    "For example, when a person $P$ pulls a sled $S$:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The person exerts a forward force on the sled, $\\vec F_{PS}$.\n",
    "- The sled exerts an equal and opposite backward force on the person, $\\vec F_{SP} = -\\vec F_{PS}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "These two forces act on **different objects**, so they cannot cancel each other. The **sled moves forward if the pull on it exceeds friction with the ground**, while **the person moves if the ground’s forward reaction on their feet exceeds the backward pull from the sled**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key points\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Forces always occur in pairs.** A single, isolated force does not exist.  \n",
    "- **Action–reaction forces act on different bodies.** Only the forces acting *on a single body* enter its $\\sum \\vec F = m\\vec a$ equation.  \n",
    "- **The origin of forces is mutual interaction.** Both objects experience forces of equal strength at the same instant.  \n",
    "- **Equal forces can produce different accelerations**, depending on each object’s mass.\n",

    "\n",
    "Newton’s laws connect forces and motion, but applying them effectively requires clear, systematic reasoning.  \n",
    "The central tool is the **free-body diagram (FBD)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **free-body diagram isolates one object and shows all external forces* acting on it** (e.g. gravity, normal, friction, tension, applied forces). The forces acting are drawn as vectors from the object’s center.  \n",

    "\n",
    "### Drawing \\& analyzing forces using the FBD:\n",

    "1. **Choose one object** to analyze.  \n",
    "   Draw it as a point (for pure translation) and sketch all forces acting on it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Label each force** with its source and direction (e.g., $\\vec F_N$, $\\vec F_g$, $\\vec F_T$).  \n",
    "   If multiple objects interact, draw a separate FBD for each.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Select a coordinate system** that simplifies the problem, e.g. by aligning one axis along the motion or incline.  \n",
    "   Forces are resolved into components along these axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Apply Newton’s second law** along each axis:\n",

    "### Net force composition\n",
    "\n",
    "When two or more forces act at a point, the **net (resultant) force** is their vector sum.  \n",
    "For two forces, this is geometrically represented by parallelogram of forces. The diagonal of the parallelogram built on the force vectors gives the resultant in both magnitude and direction.\n"
