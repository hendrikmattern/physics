    "In this chapter we introduce the physics of **fluids in motion**, where velocity fields, pressure variations, and flow patterns evolve in space and time. We begin by characterizing different types of flow and using **streamlines** to visualize motion. We then develop the **continuity equation**, expressing mass conservation in moving fluids, and derive **Bernoulli’s equation** as a key relation between pressure, speed, and height in ideal flows. Finally, we examine real-world effects such as **viscosity**, **drag**, and the **Magnus effect**, which arise when internal friction and rotation influence fluid motion.\n"

    "In large arteries and veins, blood behaves approximately as a Newtonian fluid, so Poiseuille’s law provides a good first description of flow. Flow is extremely sensitive to vessel radius ($Q \\propto R^4$), meaning vasoconstriction strongly reduces flow while vasodilation increases it. In smaller vessels, however, deviations appear: Red blood cells alter the effective viscosity, blood becomes **shear-thinning** (its viscosity decreases with shear rate), and pulsatile pressure from the heart introduces unsteady flow. Although blood is not perfectly Newtonian—especially in capillaries where cell deformation dominates—Poiseuille’s law remains an excellent first approximation for much of the systemic circulation.\n",
