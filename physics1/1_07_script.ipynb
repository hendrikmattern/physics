    "## 1.7.1. Phases of Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "All substances in the universe exist in one or more of three familiar states or **phases**: solid, liquid, and gas. These phases differ mainly in the **spacing**, **motion**, and **intermolecular forces** between their constituent particles. Understanding these distinctions is essential for fluid mechanics, since both liquids and gases—collectively called **fluids**—are able to flow and continuously deform under applied forces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solids\n",
    "In a solid, particles are tightly packed and held in place by strong intermolecular forces. They can vibrate about their equilibrium positions but cannot move freely. As a result, solids possess a definite shape and volume, exhibit high density, and are essentially incompressible. Although they can deform under applied stress, the deformation is finite and solids return to equilibrium once the stress is removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples include metals, ice, and crystalline salts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Liquids\n",
    "In a liquid, particles remain close together but are no longer fixed in a rigid structure. Intermolecular forces are weaker than in solids, allowing particles to move and rearrange. Liquids therefore have a definite volume but no fixed shape; they take the shape of their container. They are only slightly compressible and can flow, meaning they continue to deform as long as shear stress is applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples include water, oil, and mercury.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gases\n",
    "In a gas, particles are far apart and move rapidly in all directions. Intermolecular forces are negligible except during collisions. Gases have neither definite shape nor definite volume and expand to fill any container. They are highly compressible and considerably less dense than liquids or solids.\n",

    "### The Role of Temperature and Pressure\n",
    "\n",
    "Temperature measures the **average kinetic energy** of the particles in a substance. As temperature increases, molecular vibrations grow stronger and the average separation between particles tends to increase. If the thermal energy becomes large enough to overcome the attractive forces between molecules, the substance may undergo a **phase change**. At sufficiently high temperature, intermolecular attraction becomes negligible and the material exists as a gas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pressure influences phase in the opposite direction. Increasing pressure forces particles closer together, strengthening the effect of intermolecular forces and favoring condensed phases such as liquids or solids. Conversely, lowering pressure reduces the constraint on particle spacing, making it easier for a substance to vaporize. This interplay between thermal motion and external pressure determines whether a material is solid, liquid, or gas under given conditions.\n"

    "### Phase Transitions\n",
    "\n",
    "A **phase transition** occurs when a substance changes between solid, liquid, and gaseous states. During such transitions, energy is absorbed or released in the form of **latent heat**, which is used to rearrange molecular binding rather than to increase temperature. This is why a phase change at constant pressure occurs at **constant temperature**: the added or removed energy modifies molecular configuration without altering the average kinetic energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common transitions include melting and freezing between the solid and liquid phases, vaporization and condensation between liquid and gas, and sublimation or deposition between solid and gas. In each case, an endothermic transition absorbs heat to weaken molecular binding, whereas an exothermic transition releases heat as molecular attraction strengthens.\n",

The diagram shows the regions where a substance exists as solid, liquid, or gas, separated by **phase boundaries** along which transitions occur. Two special points on such diagrams are particularly important:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **triple point**, where solid, liquid, and gas coexist in equilibrium.\n",
