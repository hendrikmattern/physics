    "\n",
    "A simple yet striking observation reveals a key idea of two-dimensional motion: if one ball is dropped from the edge of a table and another is rolled horizontally off the same table at the same instant, **both hit the floor simultaneously**. The horizontal motion of the second ball has no influence on how fast it falls vertically. This experiment demonstrates the **independence of motion along perpendicular directions**, or in mathematical terms, the **superposition principle** for kinematics.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Superposition means that the overall motion of an object can be seen as the **vector sum of independent component motions**. In the case of a projectile, one motion occurs horizontally (constant velocity, no acceleration), and the other vertically (uniform acceleration due to gravity). These act simultaneously but independently, linked only by the shared time variable $t$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This idea allows a **component-wise analysis** of motion. Each coordinate axis is treated separately using the one-dimensional equations of motion, while the full trajectory and velocity are obtained by recombining the components into vector form:\n",

    "The superposition principle is **not limited to projectiles**. It is a powerful concept that reappears throughout physics. For instance, in **electromagnetic motion** (a charged particle moving simultaneously under electric and magnetic fields), in **wave interference**, and in **circular motion** (as the sum of two perpendicular harmonic motions).  \n",
