    "## 2.6.1. Electromagnets\n",
    "\n",
    "Electromagnets are devices that generate magnetic fields when an electric current flows through them. \n",
    "Two common configurations for electromagnets are solenoids and toroids.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solenoids \n",
    "A solenoid is a tightly wound helical coil of wire.\n",
    "Each loop of the coil on its own would produce a circular field but since the loops are so close to each other they start to for a magnetic field similar to that of a bar magnet, i.e. almost uniform inside the coil and a north as well as a south pole. \n",
    "The field outside the solenoid is rather weak.\n",
    "Using Amp√®re's law we can compute the magnetic field of the solenoid.\n",
    "Assume the take a rectangular path through the solenoid: first parallel but outside to the coil, then perpendicular going inside the solenoid, hence crossing the loop once, parallel inside the coil, and then going outside again perpendicularly.\n",
    "Only the portions of the path parallel to the field contribute and the path outside can be neglected as the field is very weak in comparison to inside.\n",
    "Therefore, we would write\n",
    "$$ \\oint \\vec{\\bf{B}} \\cdot d\\vec{\\bf{l}} = \\int_0^l \\vec{\\bf{B}} d \\vec{\\bf{l}} = Bl = \\mu_0 I_{enc}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "for the length $l$ along which we compute the field.\n",
    "As the enclosed current $I_{enc}$ is given determined by the current $I$ itself and the number of loops $N$, we get\n",
    "$$ B l = \\mu_0 N I \\leftrightarrow B = \\frac{\\mu_0 N I}{l}$$\n",
    "If we introduce $n$ as the loop density, i.e. the number of loops per unit length, we obtain our final equation:\n",
    "$$ B = \\mu_0 n I$$\n",
    "Technically, this solution is only true for infinitely long solenoids, but a reasonable approximation for the field inside a long solenoid. \n",
    "Solenoids are widely used in applications such as electromagnets, inductors, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Toroids  \n",
    "A toroid is a doughnut-shaped coil of wire (imagine twisting a solenoid into a circle). \n",
    "The magnetic field inside a toroid is confined within the core and is given by:  \n",
    "$$ \\oint \\vec{\\bf{B}} \\cdot d\\vec{\\bf{l}} = B 2 \\pi r = \\mu_0 I_{enc}$$\n",
    "$$ B = \\frac{\\mu_0 N I}{2 \\pi r} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Toroids are commonly used in power supplies and transformers due to their efficient confinement of magnetic fields.\n",
