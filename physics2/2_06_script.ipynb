    "## 2.6.1. Electromagnets\n",
    "\n",
    "Electromagnets are devices that generate magnetic fields when an electric current flows through them. \n",
    "Two common configurations for electromagnets are solenoids and toroids.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solenoids \n",
    "A solenoid is a tightly wound helical coil of wire.\n",
    "Each loop of the coil on its own would produce a circular field but since the loops are so close to each other they start to for a magnetic field similar to that of a bar magnet, i.e. almost uniform inside the coil and a north as well as a south pole. \n",
    "The field outside the solenoid is rather weak.\n",
    "Using Ampère's law we can compute the magnetic field of the solenoid.\n",
    "Assume the take a rectangular path through the solenoid: first parallel but outside to the coil, then perpendicular going inside the solenoid, hence crossing the loop once, parallel inside the coil, and then going outside again perpendicularly.\n",
    "Only the portions of the path parallel to the field contribute and the path outside can be neglected as the field is very weak in comparison to inside.\n",
    "Therefore, we would write\n",
    "$$ \\oint \\vec{\\bf{B}} \\cdot d\\vec{\\bf{l}} = \\int_0^l \\vec{\\bf{B}} d \\vec{\\bf{l}} = Bl = \\mu_0 I_{enc}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "for the length $l$ along which we compute the field.\n",
    "As the enclosed current $I_{enc}$ is given determined by the current $I$ itself and the number of loops $N$, we get\n",
    "$$ B l = \\mu_0 N I \\leftrightarrow B = \\frac{\\mu_0 N I}{l}$$\n",
    "If we introduce $n$ as the loop density, i.e. the number of loops per unit length, we obtain our final equation:\n",
    "$$ B = \\mu_0 n I$$\n",
    "Technically, this solution is only true for infinitely long solenoids, but a reasonable approximation for the field inside a long solenoid. \n",
    "Solenoids are widely used in applications such as electromagnets, inductors, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Toroids  \n",
    "A toroid is a doughnut-shaped coil of wire (imagine twisting a solenoid into a circle). \n",
    "The magnetic field inside a toroid is confined within the core and is given by:  \n",
    "$$ \\oint \\vec{\\bf{B}} \\cdot d\\vec{\\bf{l}} = B 2 \\pi r = \\mu_0 I_{enc}$$\n",
    "$$ B = \\frac{\\mu_0 N I}{2 \\pi r} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Toroids are commonly used in power supplies and transformers due to their efficient confinement of magnetic fields.\n",

    "## 2.6.2. Electromagnetic induction, Lenz's law &amp; Faraday's law\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous chapter we saw that (1) an electric current can produce magnetic field and (2) that a magnetic field exerts a force on electric currents as well as moving electric particles.\n",
    "It were Joseph Henry (1797-1878) and Michael Faraday (1791-1867) who described independently from each other the that a magnetic field can generate an electric current.\n",
    "The key is that not constant, but a *changing magnetic field induces an electric field*.\n",
    "We call this phenomena *electromagnetic induction*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Magnetic flux\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple experiment to illustrate electromagnetic induction is moving a bar magnet through a coil. \n",
    "The coil is connected to an ammeter and has no electric source connected.\n",
    "We will see only if the magnet is moved, a current is induced.\n",
    "The induced current itself is associated with a induced voltage and will generate a magnetic field.\n",
    "\n",
    "By experimenting with out simple setup, we see that the induced current scales with the magnetic field's magnitude, the loop size, or more specifically it's enclosed area, and the orientation of magnet to loop.\n",
    "In analogy to the electric flux $\\Phi_E$, we can define the *magnetic flux* $\\Phi_B$ (capital greek Phi) for a uniform magnetic field:\n",
    "$$ \\Phi_B = B_{\\perp} A = B A \\cos \\theta = \\vec{\\bf{B}} \\vec{\\bf{A}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "with $\\vec{\\bf{B}}$ as the magnetic field. \n",
    "Further, $\\vec{\\bf{A}}$ is the vector perpendicular to the area $A$ enclosed by the loop.\n",
    "Instead of vector multiplication, we can use scala multiplication if we know the angle $\\theta$ between $\\vec{\\bf{B}}$ and $\\vec{\\bf{A}}$ or use the project of the magnetic field perpendicular to the loop's surface area $B_{\\perp}$.\n",
    "Therefore, and in perfect analogy to the electric flux, the magnetic flux $\\Phi_B$ is maximal for an angle $\\theta= 90$ degrees and zero for a magnetic field being parallel to the coil.\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation can be generalized, to arbitrary coil shapes and non-uniform magnetic field by integrating the field over infinitesimal small area elements $d\\vec{\\bf{A}}$:\n",
    "$$ \\Phi_B = \\int \\vec{\\bf{B}} d \\vec{\\bf{A}}$$\n",
    "\n",

    "## 2.6.3. Alternating current, generators &amp; transformers\n",
    "\n",
    "While batteries generate direct current (DC), electric generators at power plants deliver alternating current (AC).\n",
    "Further, we saw that in magnetic induction, the current is induced in such way that the induced magnetic field opposes its source.\n",
    "Therefore, we should think about time-varying currents and voltages.\n",
    "In AC circuits, the time-varying voltage can be described as a sin-wave with a frequency $f$ and the *peak voltage* $V_0$:\n",
    "$$ V(t) = V_0 \\sin(2\\pi f t) = V_0 \\sin (\\omega t) $$\n",
    "with $\\omega = 2 \\pi f$.\n",
    "Therefore, the voltage alternates between $+V_0$ and $-V_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, the current $I(t)$ is:\n",
    "$$ I(t) = \\frac{V(t)}{R} = \\frac{V_0}{R} \\sin(2\\pi f t) = I_0 \\sin (\\omega t) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "with $I_0$ being the *peak current*.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the average current over a full period (or multiple of it) is zero, the associated power is non-zero.\n",
    "Due to the resistance $R$, there will be loses (e.g. heat) and the power transformed is:\n",
    "$$ P = I^2 R = I_0^2 R \\sin^2 (\\omega t) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the average $\\sin^2 (\\omega t) = \\frac{1}{2} $, the average power $\\bar{P}$ is:\n",
    "$$ \\bar{P} = \\frac{1}{2} I_0^2 R = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{V_0^2}{R} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "One should know that the voltage of an outlet does not refer to the peak voltage $V_0$ but the *root-mean-squared (RMS)* voltage.\n",
    "To obtain $I_{RMS}$ and $V_{RMS}$, we use the relation between peak and squared average $\\bar{I^2} = \\frac{1}{2} I_0^2$ &amp; $\\bar{V^2} = \\frac{1}{2} V_0^2$:\n",
    "\n",
    " $$ I_{rms} = \\sqrt{\\bar{I^2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2} I_0^2} = \\frac{I_0}{\\sqrt{2}} $$\n",
    "$$ V_{rms} = \\sqrt{\\bar{V^2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2} V_0^2} = \\frac{V_0}{\\sqrt{2}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, for a 220V outlet, the peak voltage is $\\sqrt{2} \\cdot 220 \\textrm{V} \\approx 311 \\textrm{V}  $.\n",
    "\n",
    "The average power w.r.t. RMS voltage and current is:\n",
    "$$ \\bar{P} =  I_{RMS} V_{RMS}= I_{RMS}^2 R = \\frac{V_{RMS}^2}{R} $$\n",

    "### Induction in a moving conductor\n",
    "Lets imagine an uniform magnetic field $\\vec{\\bf{B}}$ and an U-shaped wire perpendicular to it.\n",
    "If we put a conducting rod with length $l$ across the U-shaped wire and move it with the constant speed $v$ along the U, in the induced voltage is:\n",
    "$$ V_{ind} = \\frac{d\\Phi_B}{dt} = \\frac{B dA}{dt} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The area $dA$ is not dependent on the U-shaped conductor but on the length of the rod and the distance $dx$ it travels within $dt$ which we get from $v = \\frac{dx}{dt}$:\n",
    "$$ dA = l dx = l v dt$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we obtain the simple equation:\n",
    "$$ V_{ind} = \\frac{B l v dt}{dt} = B l v $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation is valid for all configuration in which $v$, $B$, and $l$ are perpendicular to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not that this equation could also have been obtained by considering the forces at play:\n",
    "Without considering the connected U-shaped wire, the charges inside the rod would effectively also move with $v$ perpendicular to $B$.\n",
    "We know that the force is then simply $F = q v B$.\n",
    "As the absent U-shaped wire prevent a current running in a closed loop, the charges get simply separated and the induced voltage is measure from one end of the rod to the other.\n",
    "The work required to move the electrons from one to the other side of the rod is $W = F l = q v B l$. \n",
    "We also defined voltage as work per unit charge.\n",
    "Hence the induced voltage is $V_{ind} = \\frac{W}{q} = \\frac{q v B l}{q} = v B l $ which is the same as the equation above.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Electric generators\n",
    "Electric generators produce alternating currents (AC) from mechanical energy by leveraging electromagnetic induction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most simple generators have a static magnetic field $\\vec{\\bf{B}}$ generated by magnet and, inside the field, a rotating *armature* with loops of wire wounded around it.\n",
    "As the connected axle rotate the armature, a voltage $V_{ind}$ is induced in the rotating coil (often refereed to as *emf*, although not a force but a voltage).\n",
    "To let a current flow, the end of the coil are connected to slip rings on the axle, enabling the generator to produce a current, ergo electric energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a uniform magnetic field, the induced voltage $V_{ind}$ is:\n",
    "$$ V_{ind} = - \\frac{d\\Phi_B}{dt} = - \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\int \\vec{\\bf{B}} d\\vec{\\bf{A}} \\right) = - \\frac{d}{dt}(B A \\cos \\theta) $$\n",
    "with $\\theta$ the angle between the magnetic field and the vector $\\vec{\\bf{A}}$ perpendicular to the area $A$ of the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation does require us to differentiate w.r.t. time. \n",
    "Only the angle $\\theta$ is time dependent (coil rotates, hence, orientation w.r.t. the magnetic field changes, field and area are constant).\n",
    "Assuming the initial angle is $\\theta_0 = 0$ and a constant rotation velocity $\\omega = \\frac{d\\theta}{dt}$ we can write:\n",
    "$$ V_{ind} = - B A \\frac{d \\cos (\\omega t)}{dt} = B A \\omega \\sin (\\omega t) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can extent this solution to $N$ loop of a coil and introduce the maximally induced voltage $V_{ind, 0} = N B A \\omega$ :\n",
    "$$ V_{ind} = N B A \\omega \\sin (\\omega t) = V_{ind, 0} \\sin (\\omega t) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a simple AC voltage and entities such as RMS can be computed as stated above.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of a generator, i.e. converting mechanical into electrical energy, can be inverted to obtain an electric *motor*.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is another important effect to be considered when talking about (moving) conductors in (changing) magnetic field:\n",
    "When conductors move inside a magnetic field or the magnetic field itself changes, loops of electrical current are induced, the so-called *eddy currents*.\n",
    "They arises from Faraday's law of induction. \n",
    "Essentially, when a magnetic field around any conductor (wire, wheel of steel, etc.) changes, the induced voltage drives the flow of electrical current within the conductor.\n",
    "These currents circulate in closed loops, often resembling swirling patterns, hence the name \"eddy currents.\" \n",
    "Further and in accordance to Lenz's law, they circulate in the direction creating a magnetic field opposing its source.\n",
    "Eddy currents have various effects, including the generation of heat due to the conductor's resistance, which is utilized in induction heating. \n",
    "They also produce a braking effect, as the magnetic field they create opposes the change that caused them, a principle used in electromagnetic brakes. \n",
    "Additionally, eddy currents find applications in non-destructive testing (detect flaws in metal materials) or metal detector (detect hidden pieces of metal).\n",
    "However, in devices like generators and transformers, eddy currents can lead to energy losses, reducing efficiency. \n",
    "When a solid conductive core within a generator is subjected to a changing magnetic field, eddy currents are induced, circulating within the core material. \n",
    "These currents, flowing through the core's resistance, generate heat, leading to energy dissipation and a reduction in overall efficiency. \n",
    "*Lamination* mitigates this by constructing the core from thin sheets of electrically insulated conductive material, commonly steel. \n",
    "This layered structure disrupts the path of eddy currents, substantially decreasing their magnitude. \n",
    "By dividing the core into numerous thin, insulated layers, the available pathways for eddy current flow are restricted, minimizing the amount of circulating current.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transformers\n",
    "With transformers, we can increase of decrease the voltage in an AC circuit.\n",
    "In essence, a transformer consists of a *primary* and *secondary* coil, usually sharing an iron core to increase the magnetic field.\n",
    "Note that the two coils do not form a closed circuit, but only their proximity is essential for the transformer to work.\n",
    "In ideal conditions, i.e. no energy loses, an AC voltage in the primary coil, will induce the voltage $V_2$ in the second coil with $N_2$ loops du to a change in the magnetic flux $\\Phi_B$:\n",
    "$$ V_2 = N_2 \\frac{d \\Phi_B}{dt} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a *self-induction* in the primary coil because the field changes with in it as well:\n",
    "$$ V_1 = N_1 \\frac{d \\Phi_B}{dt} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Dividing both equation yields the simple relation of voltages and number of loops per coil:\n",
    "$$ \\frac{V_2}{V_1} = \\frac{N_2}{N_1} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of transformers, depending on the ratio of the loop numbers:\n",
    "* step-up transformer: For $N_2 > N_1$ the voltage $V_2$ will be larger than $V_1$\n",
    "* step-down transformer: For $N_2 < N_1$ the voltage $V_2$ will be smaller than $V_1$\n",
    "\n",
    "Naturally, the conservation of energy applies to transformers.\n",
    "Assuming no loses, the power in the primary and secondary loop is equal $P_1 = P_2$ and, therefore, the current will be decreases (increased) if the voltages is decreased (increased) by the transformer:\n",
    "$$ I_1 V_1 = I_2 V_2 \\leftrightarrow \\frac{I_1}{I_2} = \\frac{N_2}{N_1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformers are found everywhere in daily life, e.g. in the power grid and (wireless) chargers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, direct currents (DC) would not work with transformers as the field ist not (constantly) changing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mutual inductance\n",
    "Let's build on our knowledge of generators and transformers to investigate *mutual inductance*.\n",
    "Again, we place two coils close to each other.\n",
    "If the current is changing in coil $1$, then there will be a voltage induced in coil $2$ according to $ V_2 = N_2 \\frac{d \\Phi_B}{dt} $.\n",
    "However, it might be handy to relate the induced voltage $V_2$, directly to the change in current in coil $1$.\n",
    "To that end, we define the proportionality constant *mutual inductance* $M_{21}$ as:\n",
    "$$ M_{21} = \\frac{N_2 \\Phi_{21}}{I_1} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the voltage induced in coil $2$ can be expressed as:\n",
    "$$ V_2 = N_2 \\frac{d \\Phi_{21}}{dt}  = - M_{21} \\frac{d I_1}{dt} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, a changing current in coil $2$ would induce the voltage $V_1$ in coil $1$ with the proportionality constant $M_{12}$\n",
    "$$ V_1  = - M_{12} \\frac{d I_2}{dt} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The mutual inductance only depends on geometric variables, i.e. the spacing between the coils and their individual shape, size, and number of loops.\n",
    "Therefore, we can use: \n",
    "$$ M = M_{21} = M_{12} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "and simplify the equations to:\n",
    "$$ V_1  = - M \\frac{d I_2}{dt} \\quad \\textrm{\\&} \\quad V_2  = - M \\frac{d I_1}{dt} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Inductance (regardless if \"mutual\" or \"self\") is expressed in units of *henry* [H] = [V s / A] = [$\\Omega$ s]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Self-inductance &amp; inductors\n",
    "\n",
    "Even for a single coil, we found the phenomenon of inductance.\n",
    "This *self-inductance* stems from the fact that as the changing current passes through the coil, a voltage is induced in the coil itself (opposed direction).\n",
    "In line to mutual inductance, we define self-inductance $L$ as a proportionality constant of relate the induced voltage $V_{ind}$ directly to the change in current:\n",
    "$$ L = \\frac{N \\Phi_b}{I} $$\n",
    "$$ V_{ind} = - N \\frac{d \\Phi_B}{dt} = -L \\frac{d I}{dt} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Self-inductance is often referred to as simply inductance and, as stated before, measured in henry [H].\n",
    "The inductance of a coil depends on its geometry.\n",
    "Inductors are devices used in electric circuits and represent along resistors and capacitors the core building blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!--- todo: symbol inductor -->\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Energy stored in the magnetic field\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume we run a changing current through an inductor with inductance $L$.\n",
    "The power would be:\n",
    "$$ P = I V_{ind} = I L \\frac{d I}{dt} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the minus sign is omitted as we supply power to oppose the induced voltage.\n",
    "As power also defined as work per unit time, we can write that the work $dW$ performed during $dt$ is:\n",
    "$$dW = P dt = I L \\frac{dI}{dt} dt = I L dI $$\n",
    "The work required in total is therefore:\n",
    "$$ W = \\int_0^I d W = \\int_0^I I L dI = \\frac{1}{2} I^2 L $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "As the energy stored has the same magnitude as the work we obtain:\n",
    "$$ U = \\frac{1}{2} L I^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This energy is stored in the magnetic field.\n",
    "If we think about energy stored in an electric field of a capacitor, we find certain similarities:\n",
    "$$ U = \\frac{1}{2} C V^2$$\n",
