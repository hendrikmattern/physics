    "*Mirrors* are designed to reflect most of the light that reaches them.\n",

    "3. the *angle of reflection* $\\theta_r$, defined as the angle between the normal and the reflected ray, is equal to the angle of incidence\n",

    "## 2.9.2 Image formation at plane mirrors: Real vs. virtual images\n",
    "\n",
    "Plane mirror are common in daily life, yet they are somewhat bizarre.\n",
    "Things appear to be behind the mirror's surface and directions behave strangely: up and down are the same, but left and right are swapped.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand this, lets consider an object in front of a plane mirror.\n",
    "Let's consider two points of the object and two rays come from each point.\n",
    "The four rays are reflected at the mirror (obeying $\\theta_i = \\theta_r$) and reach our eye.\n",
    "Obviously the real object is in front of mirror, but we perceive is as being behind/inside the mirror.\n",
    "Interestingly, the distance of the object and mirrored image to the mirror appear to be the same.\n",
    "We call these distances **object distance $d_o$** (distance object to mirror, measure perpendicular to the mirror) and **image distance $d_i$** (distance image to mirror, measure perpendicular to the mirror) and they are **equal $d_o=d_i$** (true only for plane mirror).\n",
    "Further, the object's height is the same as the image's height.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does this work?\n",
    "Let's do a ray reconstruction (see simulation below). \n",
    "Beyond the incident and reflecting rays we have to extend the reflecting rays \"behind\" the mirror.\n",
    "Where these extended rays intersect, a **image point** is formed.\n",
    "The image points for all points of the object appear at the same distance as the object is positioned from the mirror, generating the mirrored object.\n",
    "We know that there is no real object inside the mirror.\n",
    "Therefore, we call this image an **virtual image**, i.e. the rays do not cross there, only there extension. \n",
    "In contrast, **real images** are generated in rays intersect. \n",
    "In other words, we could hold a piece of paper where the real image is produced a see a projection. \n",
    "This would not work for virtual images as the rays do not intersect.\n",
    "Our brains are \"wired\" to interpret diverging rays as images, regardless if there come from an virtual or real source.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to differentiate between virtual and real images is by considering their location relative to the optical instrument (i.e. lenses, see next chapter). \n",
    "For an object positioned off-center with respect to a relevant axis, a real image typically forms on the opposite side, while a virtual image appears on the same side."

    "## 2.9.3 Image formation at curved mirrors\n",
    "\n",
    "Curved mirrors are typically spherical and can be differentiated as:\n",
    "* **convex**: surface bulged towards viewer; extend the field of view; e.g. rear view mirrors\n",
    "* **concave**: surface bulged inwards (like a cave), magnifying mirrors; e.g. shaving/cosmetics mirrors\n",
    "\n",
    "Mirrors (and lenses) have **focal points** and a **focal length**.\n",
    "To define these entities, we need incoming rays parallel to the **principle axis**.\n",
    "The principle axis is defined as the straight line perpendicular to the spherical surface a the center of the mirror.\n",
    "By considering an *object infinitely far away* from the mirror (e.g. the Sun), we *obtain parallel rays*.\n",
    "In case of a concave mirror, these incident parallel rays will be reflected and all reflected rays intersect at a single point, the so-called **focal point F**.\n",
    "In other words, the focal point is the image point of an object positioned infinitely away from the mirror.\n",
    "For an convex mirror, not the reflected rays but their extension will intersect in the focal point (virtual point).\n",
    "The focal point is positioned on the principle axis and its distance to the mirror along the principle axis, is the so-called **focal length f**.\n",
    "Interestingly, for spherical mirrors the radius $r$ of the curvature is twice the focal length $f$:\n",
    "$$f = \\frac{r}{2} \\quad \\leftrightarrow \\quad r = 2 f$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Strictly speaking, this is only true if the spherical mirror is small compared to its curvature radius, i.e. the reflected rays have only a small angle w.r.t. principle axis (paraxial rays).\n",
    "The reason for this is **spherical aberration**. \n",
    "Spherical aberration (discussed more for lenses in the next chapter) is an imaging artifact/imperfection and causes the reflecting rays to not perfectly intersect in a single point but rather in a blurry, less focused region.\n",
    "**Parabolic reflectors** show no spherical aberration but are more challenging, thus expansive, to make.\n",
    "However, for the remainder of this chapter, we will neglect spherical aberration.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Image formation via ray tracing\n",
    "We know that an object infinitely far away creates an image at the focal point (real for concave and virtual for convex mirrors), but what if the object is considerably closer (but still $\\geq f=\\frac{r}{2}$ away from the mirror)?\n",
    "To construct the image in this case, we need at least 2 of these 3 rays and their intersection is where the image is generated:\n",
    "* **parallel ray**: ray parallel to the primary axis\n",
    "* **focal point ray**: ray going through the focal point at distance $f$\n",
    "* **central point ray**: ray going through the central point at distance $r$\n",
    "\n",
    "For **concave mirrors**, the parallel ray will be reflected by the mirror and becomes a focal point ray.\n",
    "The focal point ray will be reflected by the mirror and become a parallel ray.\n",
    "Already the intersection of these two rays tells us where the image form.\n",
    "The third ray, i.e. central point ray, is by definition perpendicular to the mirror (ray along a imaginary radius line).\n",
    "Thus, the ray will be reflected perpendicular from the mirror and intersecting with the other two rays at the image point.\n",
    "\n",
    "For **convex mirrors**, the same rays are used but they must be extended \"behind\" the mirror.\n",
    "The intersection of the extended rays shows were the virtual image is formed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** convex mirrors (and lenses) always produce virtual images, regardless of the focal length or the position of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mirror equation\n",
    "We define the **object distance** $d_o$ as the distance between the mirror and the object along the principal axis.\n",
    "Analogously, we define the **image distance** $d_i$ as the distance between the image and the mirror along the principle axis.\n",
    "Further, we need the **object height** $h_o$ and the **image height** $h_i$ to put everything into relation.\n",
    "From the ratio of the heights and distances, respectively, we can derive the **mirror equation**:\n",
    "$$\\frac{h_0}{h_i}=\\frac{d_0}{d_i}$$\n",
    "Due to similar triangles in our ray diagram we see that the heights relate to the distance $d_0 -f$ and $f$:\n",
    "$$\\frac{h_0}{h_i}=\\frac{d_0-f}{f}=\\frac{d_0}{d_i}$$\n",
    "By rearranging, we obtain the final **mirror equation** which relates the distances of object and image via the focal length ($f=\\frac{r}{2}$):\n",
    "$$\\frac{1}{d_0} + \\frac{1}{d_i} = \\frac{1}{f}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that for an infinitely far away object, i.e. $d_0 = \\infty$, we obtain $d_i = f$, as expected. \n",
    "Further, for a plane mirror, i.e. $f=\\frac{r}{2}=\\infty$, we obtain $d_i = -d_o$ (virtual image at same distance but behind mirror).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Magnification\n",
    "**Lateral magnification** is defined as:\n",
    "$$m=\\frac{h_i}{h_o}=-\\frac{d_i}{d_0}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**sign convention:**\n",
    "* object height $h_o$ is always *positive*\n",
    "* image height $h_i$ is *positive* if the image is *upright*; it is *negative* if the image is inverted\n",
    "* distances, i.e. $d_i$ &amp; $d_o$, are *positive* if *in front of mirror*, *negative* if *behind mirror*\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a magnification $m\\geq1$ means that the image is at least as big as the object and upright.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Angular magnification** reflects better our perception of magnification in daily life as it compares two images instead of the image to the object (like lateral magnification):\n",
    "$$M=\\frac{\\theta_C}{\\theta_P}$$\n",
    "In essence, in this context, it compares the apparent size of the image formed by a convex/concave mirror (suffix $C$) with the apparent size of the object as seen in a plane mirror (suffix $P$)  when the object is at the same distance from both mirrors.\n",
    "For the same object, the angles are the angles subtended by the respective views at the observer's eye. The angles $\\theta_C$ &amp; $\\theta_P$ describe the apparent size of the object as seen through the curved mirror and the plane mirror, respectively.\n"
