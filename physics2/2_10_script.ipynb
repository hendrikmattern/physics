    "\n",
    "Lenses are essential for optical systems.\n",
    "Like for mirrors, the surface os a lens can be **planar**, **convex** (bulged towards the viewer), or **concave** (bulged inwards like a cave).\n",
    "Because **lenses have two surfaces**, there are different combinations of these surfaces, but the most important once for us will be **double convex** and **double concave** lenses.\n",
    "The two surfaces of a lens can have different curvatures, meaning their radii do not need to be the same.\n",
    "Note that, convex lenses are also called converging lenses, and concave lenses diverging lenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an incident ray (in air) reached the first surface of a lens, obeying *Snell's law*, it will be refracted (ignoring reflection for now).\n",
    "As the refracted ray reaches the second surface of the lens, it will be refracted again (this time transmission from lens to air).\n",
    "Like mirror, lenses have **focal points** and a **focal length**.\n",
    "Notably, and as described by the **Lensmaker's equation**, the focal length of a lens is the same for both sides even if the surfaces have different curvatures, i.e. $R_1$ and $R_2$:\n",
    "$$\\frac{1}{f} = (n-1)(\\frac{1}{R_1} + \\frac{1}{R_2})$$\n",
    "with $n$ as the index of refraction and $R$ taken as *positive* for convex and a *negative* for concave surfaces.\n",
    "As state above, both sides of the lens have the same focal length because we can turn around the lens, i.e. swap $R_1$ and $R_2$, and still obtain the same numerical result from the Lensmaker's equation.\n",
    "There is an important caveat to this equation: it assumes a **thin lens** which will be discussed in the next section.\n"

    "The **thin lens model** is very useful in geometric optics and we will use it unless stated otherwise. \n",
    "As the name suggests it approximates the lens to be thin and obey these key assumptions to simplify calculations:\n",
    "* **Paraxial rays:** Only rays that travel close to the optical axis and at small angles to it are considered. Therefore,  for small angles (expressed in radians), $\\sin(\\theta) \\approx \\theta$, $\\tan(\\theta) \\approx \\theta$, and $\\cos(\\theta) \\approx 1$.\n",
    "* **Single principal plane:** A **principal plane** is a theoretical plane within a lens where refraction can be considered to occur (instead of at the surfaces). In the thin lens approximation, the thickness of the lens is assumed to be negligible. Consequently, the two principal planes of a real lens are approximated as a single plane located at the lens's center.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **focal point of a convex lense** is defined as the image point for an object at infinite distance, i.e. where the lens would focus the incident parallel rays after refraction. \n",
    "While these incident parallel rays are often considered to be perpendicular to the principal plane, this is not a requirement. \n",
    "If parallel rays are incident at an angle to the optical axis, they will still be focused at a point located at the same **focal length** from the lens, but this point will lie off the optical axis. \n",
    "The locus of all such focal points forms the **focal plane**, which is perpendicular to the optical axis and passes through the focal point.\n",
    "The **focal point of a concave lens** is the virtual point from which the refracted rays appear to diverge when parallel rays are incident on the lens. It is the point where the backward extensions of the refracted rays intersect.\n",

    "\n",
    "We know that an object infinitely far away creates an image at the focal point. \n",
    "To construct the image for objects at closer distances, we need at least 2 of these 3 rays and their intersection is where the image is generated:\n",
    "* **parallel ray**: ray parallel to the principal axis\n",
    "* **focal point ray**: ray going through the focal point\n",
    "* **central ray (or optical center ray)**: ray going through the optical center of the lens\n",

    "Similar to image formation with mirrors, we can use principal rays to determine the location and nature of the image formed by a thin lens. \n",
    "The underlying principles share commonalities, particularly with the **parallel ray** and the **focal point ray**. \n",
    "Both mirrors and lenses can produce **real images** (where light rays actually converge) and **virtual images** (where light rays only appear to diverge from or converge to a point).\n",
    "However, there is a key difference in the third principal ray. For thin lenses, we use the **central ray (or optical center ray)**, which passes through the optical center of the lens without significant deviation. This is analogous to the **central point ray** for mirrors (passing through the center of curvature), but the refraction at the lens surfaces leads to a slightly different behavior.\n",

    "The **focal point** is real for convex lenses and virtual for concave lenses (analogous to concave and convex mirrors, respectively).\n",

    "For **convex (converging) lenses**, the parallel ray will be refracted by the lens and pass through the focal point on the opposite side.\n",
    "The focal point ray (passing through the focal point on the object side) will be refracted by the lens and become a parallel ray on the opposite side.\n",
    "Already the intersection of these two rays tells us where the image forms.\n",
    "The third ray, i.e., the central ray, passes through the optical center of the thin lens without significant deviation. \n",

    "\n",
    "For **concave (diverging) lenses**, the same rays are used, but their extensions are traced.\n",
    "The parallel ray will be refracted by the lens and appear to diverge from the focal point on the same side as the object.\n",
    "For the focal point ray, the ray is heading towards the focal point on the **opposite side**. \n",
    "Before reaching the focal point on the opposite side, the ray will be refracted by the lens and become a parallel ray.\n",
    "The intersection of the backward extensions of these refracted rays shows where the virtual image is formed on the same side as the object.\n",
    "In addition, the central ray passes through the optical center without significant deviation and intersects with the extended rays where the image forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Concave/diverging lenses always produce virtual, upright, and smaller images when the object is real and placed in front of the lens. \n",
    "Convex/converging lenses can produce both real and virtual images depending on the object's position relative to the focal point. \n",

    "**General approach**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Analyze the first lens:**\n",
    "    * Use the thin lens equation: $\\frac{1}{d_{o1}} + \\frac{1}{d_{i1}} = \\frac{1}{f_1}$\n",

    "    * **Sign convention for $d_{o2}$:**\n",
    "        * Positive if the first image is real and on the incident side of the second lens.\n",
    "        * Positive (less intuitive) if the first image is virtual and the second lens intercepts the rays as if coming from it.\n",
    "        * Negative if the first image is real and forms behind the second lens (virtual object for the second lens).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Analyze the second lens:**\n",
    "    * Use the thin lens equation for the second lens with focal length $f_2$: $\\frac{1}{d_{o2}} + \\frac{1}{d_{i2}} = \\frac{1}{f_2}$\n",

    "\n",
    "A pinhole camera is a simple lensless camera using a tiny pinhole to focus light and create an image on a light-sensitive surface. \n",
    "Pinhole cameras, also called **camera obscura**, have historical significance, and they demonstrate the basic principles of image formation in cameras.\n",
    "According to the ray model, the light rays from an object pass through a small pinhole into a light-tight box, forming an inverted image on the opposite side.\n",
    "The focal length $f$ of a pinhole camera is simply the distance between the pinhole and the image plane (the surface where the image is projected and recorded).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Image formation &amp; magnification:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an object of height $h_o$ at a distance $d_o$ from the pinhole. \n",

    "**Factors Affecting Image Quality**\n",
    "\n",
    "The sharpness of a pinhole camera image is primarily limited by the pinhole size. \n",
    "A larger pinhole causes geometric blur, while a very small pinhole leads to diffraction blur (see later chapter; wave optics). \n",
    "The optimal pinhole diameter $d_{\\textrm{pin}}$ balances these effects and is approximately given by:\n",
    "$$d_{\\textrm{pin}} \\approx \\sqrt{2.44 \\lambda f}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of light and $f$ is the focal length, i.e. distance pinhole to film/detector. \n",
    "This formula arises from minimizing the combined blur from geometric projection and diffraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another key factor is **exposure time**. \n",
    "The small pinhole allows very little light to pass, necessitating long exposures to properly expose the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Simple and inexpensive to make.\n",
    "* No chromatic or spherical aberrations (as there is no lens).\n",

    "- **Retina**: Contains photo-receptors (rods and cones) that convert light into electrical signals.\n",
    "- **Fovea**: A small region at the center of the retina where vision is sharpest (diameter $\\approx 0.25$ mm).\n",
    "- **Aqueous humor**: The transparent watery fluid which fills the space between cornea and lense; $n\\approx1.336$.\n",
    "- **Vitreous humor**: The transparent gel-like substance which fills the inside of the eye; $n\\approx1.337$.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Corrective Lenses\n",
    "Typically, the closest distance at which the human eye can still focus sharply, the so-called **near point**, is 25 cm.\n",
    "Consequently, the **far point** is the farthest distances at which the eye can still identify an object. \n",

    "## 2.10.9 Aberration \n",
    "\n",
    "Real lenses have thickness, and the approximation $\\sin \\theta \\approx \\theta$ (where $\\theta$ is the angle of the ray with the optical axis) is only valid for very small angles close to the optical axis. \n",
    "For rays farther from the axis, this approximation breaks down, leading to imperfections in image formation known as **aberrations** which can result in blurring, distortion, or other artifacts. Aberrations can be broadly classified into two categories:\n",
    "1.  **Monochromatic Aberrations**: These occur even when using light of a single wavelength (monochromatic light). They include spherical aberration, coma, astigmatism, curvature of field, and distortion.\n",
    "2.  **Chromatic Aberration**: This type of aberration arises due to the phenomenon of **dispersion** (see previous chapter), where the refractive index of a material varies with the wavelength (color) of light. This causes different colors to be focused at different points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the nature of these aberrations and how to minimize them is crucial in the design of effective optical instruments like cameras, microscopes, and telescopes.\n",
    "High-quality optical systems like camera and telescope lenses are often **compound lenses**, consisting of multiple simple lenses designed to minimize these aberrations and produce sharper images. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Spherical aberration\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:** Spherical aberration is the failure of rays farther from the optical axis to focus at the same point as rays closer to the axis when passing through a spherical lens or reflecting off a spherical mirror.\n",
    "**Cause:** The spherical shape of the lens or mirror surface causes different degrees of refraction or reflection for rays at different distances from the center. Rays passing through the edges of a converging lens are refracted more strongly and focus closer to the lens than rays passing through the center.\n",
    "**Effect:** The image of a point object is not a sharp point but a blurred circle, known as the **circle of least confusion**, at the point where the blur is minimized.\n",
    "**Correction:** Spherical aberration can be reduced by using **aspherical lenses**, which have non-spherical surfaces designed to refract or reflect all rays to a single focal point. Another method involves restricting the aperture using a **stop** to block peripheral rays, although this also reduces the light intensity. Furthermore, **compound lenses**, which combine multiple lenses with different shapes and refractive indices, can be designed to cancel out spherical aberration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coma\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:** Coma is a monochromatic aberration that causes off-axis points in the object to be imaged as asymmetrical, comet-shaped blurs. It is an additional aberration to spherical aberration due to off-axis object points.\n",
    "**Cause:** When the rays from an off-axis object point pass through different parts of the lens, they are refracted by different amounts and converge to different points in the image plane, resulting in a smear.\n",
    "**Effect:** Instead of a sharp point, the image of an off-axis point looks like a comet with a tail pointing towards or away from the optical axis.\n",
    "**Correction:** Similar to spherical aberration, coma can be minimized by using **aspherical lenses** or carefully designed **compound lenses**. Additionally, specific lens designs aim to reduce coma.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Astigmatism\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:** Astigmatism occurs when a lens or mirror has different focal lengths in two perpendicular planes for off-axis object points.\n",
    "**Cause:** This can be due to an asymmetry in the curvature of the lens surfaces or the off-axis nature of the object point. Rays in e.g. the tangential plane (containing the principal ray and the optical axis) focus at a different distance than rays in e.g. the sagittal plane (perpendicular to the tangential plane).\n",
    "**Effect:** A point object is imaged as two short line segments oriented perpendicular to each other at different focal distances. This makes it impossible to obtain a sharply focused image of a point.\n",
    "**Correction:** Astigmatism can be corrected by using a combination of lenses with specific curvatures. In some cases, **cylindrical lenses** are used to compensate for the irregular curvature causing astigmatic errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Curvature of Field\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:** Curvature of field is an aberration where the image of a flat object is formed on a curved surface rather than a flat plane.\n",
    "**Cause:** The focal points for object points at different distances from the optical axis lie on a curved surface.\n",
    "**Effect:** When a flat object is focused, the center of the image might be sharp, but the edges are blurred, or vice versa, because the image plane (which is typically flat, like a camera sensor) cannot simultaneously be at the correct focal distance for all parts of the curved image surface.\n",
    "**Correction:** To correct curvature of field, optical systems can employ **field-flattening lenses** that ensure a flat image is projected onto a flat image plane. Specific lens designs can also be implemented to minimize the curvature of the field.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distortion\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:** Distortion is an aberration that causes the shape of the image to be different from the shape of the object, even though the image might be in focus. Straight lines in the object appear curved in the image.\n",
    "**Types of Distortion:**\n",
    "* **Barrel Distortion**: Occurs when the magnification decreases with distance from the optical axis. Straight lines appear to bow outwards, like the shape of a barrel. This is common in wide-angle lenses.\n",
    "* **Pincushion Distortion**: Occurs when the magnification increases with distance from the optical axis. Straight lines appear to bow inwards, like the shape of a pincushion. This can be seen in some telephoto lenses.\n",
    "**Cause:** Non-uniform magnification across the field of view of the lens.\n",
    "**Correction:** Distortion can be minimized by using **symmetric compound lenses**, where the lens elements are arranged symmetrically around a central stop. Additionally, software correction can be applied to digital images to reduce distortion.\n",

    "### Chromatic Aberration\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:** Chromatic aberration arises from the fact that the refractive index of a lens material varies with the wavelength (color) of light. This phenomenon is known as **dispersion**.\n",
    "**Cause:** When white light passes through a lens, different colors are refracted by different amounts. For example, blue light is refracted more than red light. This causes different colors to focus at different points along the optical axis.\n",
    "**Effect:** The image of a white object may show colored fringes, especially at the edges where there is a high contrast between bright and dark areas.\n",
    "**Correction:** Chromatic aberration can be corrected by using an **achromatic doublet**, which consists of two lenses made of different types of glass (with different refractive indices and dispersions) cemented together. The combination is designed to bring two different wavelengths (typically red and blue) to the same focal point. For even better correction, **apochromatic lenses** are used, which employ special types of glass to bring three or more wavelengths to the same focus, significantly reducing chromatic aberration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aberrations in Mirrors\n",
    "**Spherical Aberration in Mirrors:** Spherical mirrors also suffer from spherical aberration for the same geometric reasons as spherical lenses. Rays reflecting from the outer parts of the mirror focus at a different point than rays reflecting from the center.\n",
    "**Correction:** Spherical aberration in mirrors can be corrected by using **parabolic mirrors**, which are specifically shaped to focus all parallel rays to a single point, thus eliminating spherical aberration for objects at infinity. Similar to lenses, restricting the aperture can reduce the effects of spherical aberration in mirrors.\n",
    "**Advantage of Mirrors:** Reflecting surfaces do not exhibit chromatic aberration because reflection does not depend on the wavelength of light in the same way that refraction does.\n",
