    "## 2.7.1. The LR-circuit\n",
    "Let begin our journey through circuits and oscillations, with a simple DC circuit.\n",
    "Imagine a simple circuit consisting of an ideal voltage source $ V_0 $, an ideal resistor $ R $, and an ideal inductor $ L $ in series. \n",
    "This LR-circuit is fundamental in electronics, particularly in applications like power supplies, radio circuits, and more. \n",
    "Unlike the RC-circuit, which involves a capacitor, the LR-circuit focuses on the behavior of an inductor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's investigate the LR-circuit is analyzed under two conditions: when the circuit is switched on and when it is switched off. \n",
    "Switching on the circuit allows the inductor to oppose the change in current, while switching off demonstrates the inductor's attempt to maintain current.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Switching on the DC supply\n",
    "\n",
    "When the circuit is closed, the inductor initially opposes the change in current, causing the current to rise gradually over time instead of instantaneously from zero to its maximum value. \n",
    "To analyze this, we apply Kirchhoff's loop rule, which states that the sum of the voltage changes around a closed loop is zero. \n",
    "For the LR-circuit, the DC supply provides $V_0$, the voltage drop across the resistor is $ V_R = I R $, and the voltage across the inductor is $ V_L = L \\frac{dI}{dt} $.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the loop equation becomes:\n",
    "$$ V_0 - L \\frac{dI}{dt} - I R = 0$$\n",
    "$$ V_0 = L \\frac{dI}{dt} + I R $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, the sum of the voltage drops over the resistor and inductor is constant over time, i.e. $V_0$, but their relative contribution changes.\n",
    "Immediately after switching on, the voltage drop appears completely over the inductor due to its induced voltages (opposed direction to in source, Lenz's law).\n",
    "Over time, the voltage over the inductor reduces as the change in magnetic field diminishes because the change in current becomes smaller and smaller.\n",
    "Eventually, i.e. steady state, no voltage drop over the inductor occurs and the entire voltage drop is at the resistor with $V_0 = R I_0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's analyze this mathematically.\n",
    "To solve the first-order linear ordinary differential equation from above, we start by separating the variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ L \\frac{dI}{dt} + R I = V_0$$\n",
    "$$ \\frac{dI}{dt} = \\frac{V_0 - R I}{L}$$\n",
    "$$ \\frac{dI}{V_0 - R I} = \\frac{dt}{L}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we integrate both sides from $ t = 0 $ with the current being zero to time $ t $ with the current being $I$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\int_0^I \\frac{dI}{V_0 - R I} = \\int_0^t \\frac{dt}{L}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us substitute the following: $ u = V_0 - R I $. \n",
    "Therefore we also get $ du = -R dI \\leftrightarrow dI = -\\frac{du}{R}$, and integrate:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ -\\frac{1}{R} \\int_{V_0}^{V_0 - R I} \\frac{du}{u} = \\int_0^t \\frac{dt}{L}$$\n",
    "$$ -\\frac{1}{R} \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_0 - R I}{V_0}\\right) = \\frac{t}{L}$$\n",

    "$$ \\frac{V_0 - R I}{V_0} = e^{-\\frac{R t}{L}}$$\n",
    "$$ V_0 - R I = V_0 e^{-\\frac{R t}{L}}$$\n",
    "$$ R I = V_0 (1 - e^{-\\frac{R t}{L}})$$\n",
    "$$ I(t) = \\frac{V_0}{R} (1 - e^{-\\frac{t}{\\tau}}) \\quad \\textrm{with} \\quad \\tau = \\frac{L}{R}  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The current asymptotically approaches $ \\frac{V_0}{R} $ with a time constant $ \\tau = \\frac{L}{R} $.\n",
    "In line with the RC-circuit, $\\tau$ is in seconds ($\\Omega$/H = (V/A)/(Vs/A) = s) and after $\\tau$ the current $I(\\tau)$ reached 63% of its maximum value.\n",
    "While the equations suggest, that $I(t)$ never reach their final value, it is fair to assume that after $5\\tau$ the process is completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Switching off the DC supply\n",
    "\n",
    "When the circuit is switched off, the same logic applied, i.e. the inductor impedes the change in current.\n",
    "Thus, the inductor attempts to maintain the current, leading to a gradual decay instead of a suddenly vanishing current. \n",
    "With the voltage source removed ($ V_0 = 0 $), Kirchhoff's loop rule gives:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ L \\frac{dI}{dt} + R I = 0$$\n",
    "\n",

    "Before investigating circuits with AC power sources, we will analyze circuits which oscillate, i.e. have an inductance and capacitance in them.\n",
    "We start with the most simple case, the LC-circuit before finishing with the LRC-circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### LC-circuit\n",
    "Let us explore the LC-circuit, a fundamental system in electronics that introduces the concept of electromagnetic oscillations. \n",
    "Unlike the LR-circuit, which includes a resistor, the LC-circuit consists of only three elements connected in series: an ideal capacitor, an ideal inductor, and an open switch. \n",
    "Imagine the capacitor is fully charged at time $t = 0$ with the charges $+Q$ and $-Q$ on each plate, respectively. \n",
    "There is no additional voltage source and at $t=0$ the voltage across the plates of the capacitor is $V = \\frac{Q}{C}$. \n",
    "When the circuit is closed, the capacitor begins to discharge through the inductor. \n",
    "The inductor opposes this change in current due to (self-)induction.\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyze the LC-circuit, we apply Kirchhoff's loop rule. \n",
    "The total voltage around the loop must sum to zero:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ - L \\frac{dI}{dt} + \\frac{Q}{C} = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the current of the capacitor is decreasing (positive charge plate discharges) and current is derivative of charge w.r.t. time, we can write $ I = -\\frac{dQ}{dt} $.\n",
    "Using this relation the minus sign vanishes. \n",
    "We rearrange the equation to to obtain a second order linear differential equation that describes simple harmonic motion:\n",
    "$$ \\frac{d^2 Q}{dt^2} + \\frac{Q}{LC}  = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The general solution for this differential equation is:\n",
    "$$ Q = Q_0 \\cos(\\omega t + \\phi)$$\n",

    "\n",
    "This equation is true for all case were $ (-\\omega^2 + \\frac{1}{LC}) = 0$. \n",
    "Thus, the angular frequency of oscillation $\\omega = 2 \\pi f$ is:\n",

    "with the maximum current $I_0 = \\omega Q_0 = \\frac{Q}{\\sqrt{LC}} $.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The energy in the LC-circuit is conversed and oscillates between the capacitor and the inductor.\n",
    "Initially, the capacitor is fully charged, storing electrical energy. \n",
    "As it discharges, electrical energy is converted into magnetic energy stored in the inductor.\n",
    "The capacitor is not an indefinite source of charge. \n",
    "Hence, after reaching the maximum current, i.e. the inductor has all energy stored in it, the current decreases.\n",
    "This change in current causes yet another induction which induces a voltage in opposite direction to before, effectively charging the capacitor (in opposite direction to the initial condition) to start the cycle all over again.\n",
    "This energy exchange between the capacitor and inductor continues, resulting in oscillations of charge, current, and voltage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The energy in the inductor $U_B$ and capacitor $U_E$ are (see previous chapters):\n",
    "$$ U_B = \\frac{1}{2} LI^2 = \\frac{L \\omega^2 Q_0^2}{2} \\sin^2(\\omega t + \\phi) = \\frac{Q_0^2}{2 C} \\sin^2(\\omega t + \\phi) $$\n",

    "The angular frequency $\\omega$ determines the oscillation frequency, which is crucial for tuning and resonance in such applications.\n",

    "The LRC-circuit consists of an ideal inductor $L$, an ideal resistor $R$, and an ideal capacitor $C$ connected in series. \n",
    "Unlike the energy conversion in the LC-circuit, the resistor adds losses in form of heat and, therefore, introduces damping, causing the oscillations to decay over time.\n",

    "With these tools we can also analyze simpler circuit by simply setting the resistance/reactance of one component to zero.\n",

    "### Impedance Matching\n",
    "\n",
    "When transferring power between circuits, *impedance matching* ensures maximum efficiency. \n",
    "This occurs when the impedance of the circuit providing power $Z_1$ matches the impedance of the *load* $Z_2$:\n",
    "$$Z_1 = Z_2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand this, let's assume a simple circuit $1$ with the voltage source $V$ and a single resistor $R_1$ in series.\n",
    "Connected to this is circuit $2$ which will be represented by a single load $R_2$ (could be the equivalent net resistance of the entire circuit).\n",
    "As the same current flows $I$ to both circuits, the power delivered to circuit $2$ would be $P=I^2 R_2$.\n",
    "The relation of the current $I$ and source voltage $V$ is simply $ V = I (R_1 + R_2) \\leftrightarrow I = \\frac{V}{R_1 + R_2}$.\n",
    "Combining this gives us:\n",
    "$$ P = I^2 R_2 = (\\frac{V}{R_1 + R_2})^2 R_2 = \\frac{V^2 R_2}{(R_1 + R_2)^2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the maximum delivered power, we take the derivate w.r.t. $R_2$ (usually we can design our load circuit but the power delivery circuit is fixed, thus $R_1$ is fixed):\n",
    "$$ \\frac{dP}{dR_2} = \\frac{d}{dR_2} \\left(\\frac{V^2 R_2}{(R_1 + R_2)^2}\\right) = \\frac{V^2 (R_1 - R_2)}{(R_1 + R_2)^3} = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, $R_1 = R_2$ satisfies the equation.\n",
    "As a pure Ohmic impedance, is still an impedance, we can generalize our finding to the above mentioned statement that the maximum power is delivered if the impedances match, i.e. $Z_1 = Z_2$.\n",
    "If impedances are mismatched the power transfer is inefficient and transferred signals can be **distorted**, leading to erroneous results in experimental or communication systems.\n",
