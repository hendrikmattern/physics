    "$$ \\Phi_E = \\vec{\\bf{E}} \\vec{\\bf{A}} $$\n",
    "with $\\vec{\\bf{A}}$ as the vector perpendicular to the surface of $A$ and a magnitude of $A$\n",

    "While a spherical surface was convenient in the above thought experiment, any surface could have been used, providing the identical solution. As long as the same charge distribution is enclosed, the choice of surface will not affect the number of field lines passing through the surface.

    "## 2.2.2. Electric potential\n",
    "\n",
    "In line with for example mechanics, the concept of conservation of energy applied to electricity. \n",
    "So when in doubt about the ramifications of energy in electricity, try to think about  a similar problem in mechanics, i.e. think about gravitation, but keep in mind that gravitation only causes attraction, while in electricity attraction and repulsion occur.\n",

    "### Electric potential energy\n",
    "Similar to other types of potential energy, there is *electric potential energy* and it is defined (like all potential energies) for a conservative force, i.e. the electrostatic force ($F=k \\frac{Q_1 Q_2}{r^2}$). \n",
    "Note the similarity to potential energy due to gravitation, e.g. the $1/r^2$ dependency. \n",
    "Further, the change in energy is independent of the path taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a homogeneous electric field, the work $W$ required to move a test charge $q$ from point $A$ to point $b$ depends on the distance $d$ between $A$ &amp; $B$ and the required force $F$. \n",
    "Since the electric field $E$ is defined as the force per unit charge $E = \\frac{F}{q}$, we obtain:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$W = Fd = qEd$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the change in potential energy $\\Delta U$ is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the work, we get:\n",
    "$$ \\Delta U = U_B - U_A = -W  \\quad \\textnormal{in [J]}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In line with mechanics, potential energy is transformed into kinetic energy $K$ while the total amount of energy is conserved.\n",
    "However, there is a conceptional difference to gravitation which we need to consider: \n",
    "While mass is positive, charge can be negative and positive. \n",
    "This has consequences for where the electric potential energy is minimal.\n",
    "Imagine oppositely charged plates generating a uniform electric field:\n",
    "* for a positive charge, the highest electric potential energy is at positive plate\n",
    "* for a negative charge, the highest electric potential energy is at negative plate\n",
    "The closer a particle is to the plate of the same polarity, the higher the electrostatic force.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the electric force does positive work on a charge, i.e. it moves the charge towards the oppositely charged plate, the kinetic energy increases while the potential energy decreases (total energy is conserved).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Voltage: The difference in electric potential \n",
    "\n",
    "The electric potential $V$ is defined as electric potential energy per unit charge. \n",
    "Note how electric potential is formulated analogously to the electric field (force per unit charge).\n",
    "The potential at point $A$ depends on the electric potential energy at that point divided by the charge:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ V_A = \\frac{U_A}{q}  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Like in mechanics, the potential energy at a point in space alone is not very informative, only *differences in potential energy* can be measured.\n",
    "Following the analogy with mechanics, we can chose the *point of zero electrical potential energy* arbitrarily. \n",
    "Commonly the Earth, i.e. *ground*, is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the potential difference between point $A$ and $B$ is :\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ V_{BA} = V_B - V_A \\quad \\textnormal{in [J/C] =[V]}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Acknowledging Alessandro Volta's (1745-1827, inventor of the electric battery) contribution to the field, we refer to Joules per Coulomb $\\textnormal{J}/\\textnormal{C}$ as *volt* $\\textnormal{V}$ and, consequently, the potential difference as *voltage*.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize:\n",
    "* electric potential is defined for a single point in space, i.e. $V_A$. \n",
    "* we can only measure potential difference, i.e. voltage, \n",
    "* we can define arbitrarily a reference point with zero electric potential, typically using ground\n",
    "* the voltage $V_BA$ between $A$ and $B$ is the potential difference $V_{BA} = V_B - V_A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Putting it all together\n",
    "We can combine the following into one equation:\n",
    "* voltage is the difference in electric potential \n",
    "* electric potential is electric potential energy over unit charge\n",
    "* changes in electric potential energy are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the performed work\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ V_{BA} = V_B - V_A = \\frac{U_B - U_A}{q} = \\frac{\\Delta U_{BA}}{q} =- \\frac{W_{BA}}{q} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us the following insides:\n",
    "* the electric potential difference, i.e. voltage, causes a charge to move from $A$ to $B$ which causes a difference in potential energy of the charge equal to: $ \\Delta U_BA = q V_{BA}$\n",
    "* as acquired energy directly relates to work, voltage is a measure of how much work a charge \"can do\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the work as well as electric potential energy will depend on the charge and voltage $W_{BA} = q V_{BA} $.\n",
    "This is similar to gravitation. \n",
    "Instead of a height $h$, we have a difference in electric potential $V_{BA}$, and instead of a mass $m$, we have a charge $q$ ($q$ can be positive or negative, but $m$ only be positive)\n",
    "\n",
    "As electric sources, such as batteries and generators, are designed to maintain a potential difference, the work they can perform will scale with the charge. \n",
    "As the amount of charge flowing through e.g. a wire depends on the time interval, the work generated scales with time itself. \n",
    "More on that topic in a later chapter.\n",
