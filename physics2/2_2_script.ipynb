    "For a uniform electric field, the electric flux $\\Phi_E$ of the field $\\vec{\\bf{E}}$ through an area $A$ is given by: \n",
    "$$ \\Phi_E = \\vec{\\bf{E}} \\vec{\\bf{A}} $$\n",
    "with $\\vec{\\bf{A}}$ as the vector perpendicular to the surface of $A$ and a magnitude of $A$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using $\\cos \\theta$ as the angle between $\\vec{\\bf{E}}$ &amp; $\\vec{\\bf{A}}$, the equation can be rewritten as:\n",

    "Depending on the interpretation, either the field component perpendicular to the area, or the projection of $A$ perpendicular to $E$ is considered.\n",

    "Most importantly, the electric flux relates to the field lines, i.e. the strength of the electric field being represented by the density of field lines. Or framed differently, the number of field lines $N$ passing through an area perpendicular to the field is proportional to the electric flux:\n",

    "## 2.2.2. Gauss's law\n",
    "Named after Karl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855), the law states that the electric flux through a closed surface is equal to the net charge enclosed in the surface $Q_{enc}$ divided by the permittivity of free space $\\epsilon_0$: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\oint \\vec{\\bf{E}} d\\vec{\\bf{A}} = \\frac{Q_{enc}}{\\epsilon_0}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the flux through the surface is independent of:\n",
    "* the distribution of the enclosed charged within the surface/volume \n",
    "* charges outside the surface which might affect the position of the electric field lines through the surface, but not the number of field lines\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relation to Coulomb's law (thought experiment)\n",
    "* imaging a spherical surface with a single enclosed charge $Q_{enc}$ in the center of the sphere (radius $r$)\n",
    "* the $\\vec{\\bf{E}}$ field will oriented radially w.r.t. enclosed charge\n",
    "* the field line will penetrate the spherical surface perpendicular and, therefore, will be parallel to the vector d\\vec{\\bf{A}}\n",
    "* the field will have the same magnitude throughout the surface, since the charge is centered inside the sphere and, therefore, the surface having the distance $r$ to the charge everywhere\n",
    "* the area of the spherical surface is $\\oint dA = 4\\pi r^2 $ \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{Q_{enc}}{\\epsilon_0} = \\oint \\vec{\\bf{E}} d\\vec{\\bf{A}} = \\oint E dA = E \\oint dA = 4 \\pi r^2 E $$\n",

    "With, $Q_{enc} = Q$, we obtain Coulomb's law in the electric field form:\n",
    "$$ E= \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{Q}{r^2} $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While a spherical surface was convenient in the above thought experiment, any surface could have been used, providing the identical solution. As long as the same charge distribution is enclosed, the choice of surface will not affect the number of field lines passing through the surface. Hence, the electric flux will be the same regardless if a spherical surface $A_1$ or an arbitrarily shaped surface $A_2$ is considered:\n",
    "$$ \\oint_{A1} \\vec{\\bf{E}} d\\vec{\\bf{A}} = \\oint_{A2} \\vec{\\bf{E}} d\\vec{\\bf{A}} = \\frac{Q_{enc}}{\\epsilon_0}$$\n",

    "Coulomb's law and Gauss's law can be applied to electrics fields produced by static electric charges. Beyond that, i.e. studying electric field due to changing magnetic fields, only  Gauss's law is applicable, hence, Gauss's law is considered to be more general description of electric fields. \n",
