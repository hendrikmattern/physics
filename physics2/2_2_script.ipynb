    "So when in doubt about the ramifications of energy in electricity, try to think about  a similar problem in mechanics, i.e. think about gravitation, but keep in mind that gravitation only causes attraction, while in electricity attraction and repulsion occur.\n",

    "### Electric potential energy\n",
    "Similar to other types of potential energy, there is *electric potential energy* and it is defined (like all potential energies) for a conservative force, i.e. the electrostatic force ($F=k \\frac{Q_1 Q_2}{r^2}$). \n",
    "Note the similarity to potential energy due to gravitation, e.g. the $1/r^2$ dependency. \n",
    "Further, the change in energy is independent of the path taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a homogeneous electric field, the work $W$ required to move a test charge $q$ from point $A$ to point $b$ depends on the distance $d$ between $A$ &amp; $B$ and the required force $F$. \n",
    "Since the electric field $E$ is defined as the force per unit charge $E = \\frac{F}{q}$, we obtain:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$W = Fd = qEd$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the change in potential energy $\\Delta U$ is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the work, we get:\n",
    "$$ \\Delta U = U_B - U_A = -W  \\quad \\textnormal{in [J]}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In line with mechanics, potential energy is transformed into kinetic energy $K$ while the total amount of energy is conserved.\n",
    "However, there is a conceptional difference to gravitation which we need to consider: \n",
    "While mass is positive, charge can be negative and positive. \n",
    "This has consequences for where the electric potential energy is minimal.\n",
    "Imagine oppositely charged plates generating a uniform electric field:\n",
    "* for a positive charge, the highest electric potential energy is at positive plate\n",
    "* for a negative charge, the highest electric potential energy is at negative plate\n",
    "The closer a particle is to the plate of the same polarity, the higher the electrostatic force.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the electric force does positive work on a charge, i.e. it moves the charge towards the oppositely charged plate, the kinetic energy increases while the potential energy decreases (total energy is conserved).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Voltage: The difference in electric potential \n",
    "\n",
    "The electric potential $V$ is defined as electric potential energy per unit charge. \n",

    "The potential at point $A$ depends on the electric potential energy at that point divided by the charge:\n",

    "\n",
    "Acknowledging Alessandro Volta's (1745-1827, inventor of the electric battery) contribution to the field, we refer to Joules per Coulomb $\\textnormal{J}/\\textnormal{C}$ as *volt* $\\textnormal{V}$ and, consequently, the potential difference as *voltage*.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize:\n",
    "* electric potential is defined for a single point in space, i.e. $V_A$. \n",
    "* we can only measure potential difference, i.e. voltage, \n",
    "* we can define arbitrarily a reference point with zero electric potential, typically using ground\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Putting it all together\n",
    "We can combine the following into one equation:\n",
    "* voltage is the difference in electric potential \n",
    "* electric potential is electric potential energy over unit charge\n",
    "* changes in electric potential energy are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the performed work\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ V_{BA} = V_B - V_A = \\frac{U_B - U_A}{q} = \\frac{\\Delta U_{BA}}{q} =- \\frac{W_{BA}}{q} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us the following insides:\n",
    "* the electric potential difference, i.e. voltage, causes a charge to move from $A$ to $B$ which causes a difference in potential energy of the charge equal to: $ \\Delta U_{BA} = q V_{BA}$\n",
    "* as acquired energy directly relates to work, voltage is a measure of how much work a charge \"can do\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the work as well as electric potential energy will depend on the charge and voltage $W_{BA} = -q V_{BA} $.\n",
    "This is similar to gravitation. \n",
    "Instead of a height $h$, we have a difference in electric potential $V_{BA}$, and instead of a mass $m$, we have a charge $q$ ($q$ can be positive or negative, but $m$ only be positive)\n",
    "\n",
    "As electric sources, such as batteries and generators, are designed to maintain a potential difference, the work they can perform will scale with the charge. \n",
    "As the amount of charge flowing through e.g. a wire depends on the time interval, the work generated scales with time itself. \n",

    "Using the *gradient operator* $\\vec{\\bf{\\nabla}}$ (also called nabla operator or del operator), obtain the solution as\n",
    "$$ \\vec{\\bf{E}} = - \\textnormal{grad} V = - \\vec{\\bf{\\nabla}} V $$\n",

    "In essence, it tells us that the electric field is proportional to the negative rate of change (a.k.a. slope) of $V$ along each dimension.\n",

    "### Electrostatic potential energy\n",
    "The change in electrostatic potential energy $\\Delta U_{AB}$ a test charge $q$ experiences as it moves from point $A$ to $B$ is:\n",
    "$$ \\Delta U_{AB} = U_B - U_A = q ( V_B - V_A) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have only a *single* charge, no electric force is exerted on it, hence, the electric potential energy is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a system of *two* point charges $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ with their distance $r_{12}$.\n",
    "If $Q_1$ remains stationary and $Q_2$ is brought closer, the voltage at the position of $Q_2$ and induced by the charge $Q_1$ will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ V = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{Q_1}{r_{12}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    " Setting the voltage at infinity to zero, the potential energy is:\n",
    " $$ U = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{Q_1 Q_2}{r_{12}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This idea can be extended to systems with more point charges by considering the interactions between each pair of point charges.\n",

    "### The electron volt\n",
    "\n",
    "While not a SI-unit, the *electron volt* (eV) is often used when dealing with energies of particles, atoms, or molecules.\n",
    "It simply relies on the idea of relating the energy to the magnitude of charge of an electron $q=e$.\n",
    "Therefore, an electron volt describes the energy required to move an electron moving through a potential difference of 1V.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 1 \\textnormal{eV} \\approx 1.60 \\times 10^{-19} J $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Equipotential lines &amp; surfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw that changes in electric potential occur only if the path is parallel to the electric field $\\vec{\\bf{E}} \\shortparallel d\\vec{\\bf{l}}$.\n",
    "Therefore, movement perpendicular to the field, i.e. $\\vec{\\bf{E}} \\perp d\\vec{\\bf{l}}$, does not require any work and there is *no difference in electric potential*.\n",
    "These configurations of zero change in potential are called *equipotential line* and *equipotential surfaces* for 2D and 3D, respectively.\n",
