    "* the image of the first lens (objective) becomes the object for the second lens (eyepiece)\n",
    "* objective lens forms a real, inverted image near its focal point\n",
    "* eyepiece lens acts as a magnifying glass producing a virtual, inverted final image\n",

    "## Aberration\n",
    "\n",
    "### introduction\n",
    "* aberration refers to imperfections in image formation due to the breakdown of the small angle approximation \n",
    "* real lenses have thickness and imperfections that can lead to blurring or distortion\n",
    "\n",
    "### types of aberrations\n",
    "* monochromatic aberrations occur with a single wavelength and include spherical aberration, coma, astigmatism, curvature of field, and distortion\n",
    "* chromatic aberration arises from dispersion where different wavelengths are refracted by different amounts\n",
    "\n",
    "### spherical aberration\n",
    "* occurs when rays far from the optical axis focus at different points than rays close to the axis\n",
    "* causes a blurred image or a circle of least confusion\n",
    "* correction methods include aspherical lenses, aperture stops, or compound lenses\n",
    "\n",
    "### coma\n",
    "* causes off-axis points to be imaged as asymmetrical, comet-shaped blurs\n",
    "* results from off-axis rays being refracted by different amounts\n",
    "* can be minimized using aspherical or carefully designed compound lenses\n",
    "\n",
    "### astigmatism\n",
    "* happens when a lens or mirror has different focal lengths in two perpendicular planes\n",
    "* a point object is imaged as two short perpendicular line segments\n",
    "* correction involves using a combination of lenses or cylindrical lenses\n",
    "\n",
    "### curvature of field\n",
    "* the image of a flat object is formed on a curved surface instead of a flat plane\n",
    "* results in a sharp center with blurred edges or vice versa\n",
    "* field-flattening lenses or specific lens designs can correct this aberration\n",
    "\n",
    "### distortion\n",
    "* causes the shape of the image to differ from the shape of the object\n",
    "* barrel distortion makes straight lines bow outwards and pincushion distortion makes them bow inwards\n",
    "* symmetric compound lenses or software correction can reduce distortion\n",
    "\n",
    "### chromatic aberration\n",
    "* arises because the refractive index of a lens varies with the wavelength of light\n",
    "* results in colored fringes especially at high contrast edges\n",
    "* achromatic doublets or apochromatic lenses are used for correction\n",
    "\n",
    "### aberrations in mirrors\n",
    "* spherical aberration in mirrors occurs for the same geometric reasons as in lenses\n",
    "* parabolic mirrors can correct spherical aberration for objects at infinity\n",
    "* mirrors do not exhibit chromatic aberration because reflection is independent of wavelength\n",
    "\n",
    "### summary of aberrations\n",
    "* spherical aberration: caused by the spherical shape of the lens/mirror; corrected by aspherical lenses, aperture stops, or compound lenses\n",
    "* coma: off-axis rays cause a comet-shaped blur; minimized with aspherical or compound lenses\n",
    "* astigmatism: different focal lengths in perpendicular planes; corrected by lens combinations or cylindrical lenses\n",
    "* curvature of field: focal points on a curved surface lead to uneven focus; corrected with field-flattening lenses\n",
    "* distortion: non-uniform magnification leads to curved lines; minimized with symmetric compound lenses or digital correction\n",
    "* chromatic aberration: dispersion causes colored fringes; corrected with achromatic doublets or apochromatic lenses\n"
