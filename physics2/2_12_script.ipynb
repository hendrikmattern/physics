    "## 2.12.1 Revisiting the double-slit experiment: Diffraction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous chapter, we studied the double-slit experiment by using interference between a discrete number of waves, i.e. two waves.\n",
    "Waves \"bend\", i.e. **diffract**, at a interface which are comparable in size to the wavelength.\n",
    "We described resulting pattern of bright and dark fringes from the double-slit experiment by interference:\n",
    "* **Constructive interference**, where path differences are integer multiples of the wavelength, leads to bright fringes. \n",
    "* **Destructive interference**, with half-integer multiples, results in dark fringes. \n",
    "\n",
    "But, there is a catch we did not consider so far: Simple **interference predicts equally bright fringes, in reality, the intensity of these fringes is modulated**, with the central ones being the brightest, and their intensity decreasing as you move away from the center. \n",
    "This suggests that each slit itself is acting as a source of waves (compare Huygens' principle) that interfere with each other in a more complex way. This phenomenon, responsible for the intensity variations, is called **diffraction**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interference vs. diffraction\n",
    "Interference and diffraction are **fundamentally the same phenomenon**, both stemming from the **superposition of coherent waves**. \n",
    "The distinction often lies in the conceptualization and source arrangement: \n",
    "* **Interference** typically involves superposition from a few discrete sources, like the two rays.\n",
    "* **Diffraction** involves the superposition from a continuous distribution of sources or a large number of closely spaced sources. \n",
    "\n",
    "Think of water waves spreading out after passing through a narrow opening in a barrier. \n",
    "Light behaves similarly, bending around obstacles or spreading out after passing through narrow apertures. \n",
    "Essentially, diffraction can be seen as the interference of a wave with itself, where each point on a wavefront acts as a source of secondary wavelets (Huygens' principle).\n"

    "## 2.12.2 Diffraction at a single-slit\n",
    "\n",
    "Before mathematically describing the intensity variation of the double-slit experiment, let's start with an easier set up: the **diffraction patterns at a single-slit**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider **monochromatic light from a coherent source** (all waves have same wavelength $\\lambda$ and phase) passing through a single narrow slit of **width $D$** ($D$ similar to $\\lambda$). \n",
    "This results in a diffraction pattern on a distant screen, characterized by a central bright maximum flanked by minima and weaker secondary maxima.\n",
    "\n",
    "The diffraction pattern arises from the interference of waves originating from different parts of the slit.\n",
    "Following the logic from the interference at the double-slit, we can see that the path difference is $\\Delta = D \\sin \\theta$ (assuming screen is far away from slit), and, therefore the relation to the wavelength $\\lambda$ can be described as:\n",
    "$$D \\sin \\theta = m \\lambda$$\n",
    "with $m$ as the order. \n",
    "Note that $n$ can be a rational number and, not as in previous section, an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the zero-th order, we obtain a maximum, i.e. the **central maximum**.\n",
    "**Higher-order maxima** can also be obtained.\n",
    "Not that the intensity of these maxima will be lower than of the central maximum, because we will always have constructive and destructive interference (consider not only two but many rays equidistantly placed across the slit).\n",
    "Let's pick $\\theta$ such that the **path difference between the outer most rays is $\\frac{3}{2}\\lambda$**.\n",
    "In that case the rays from the central third will destructively interfere with rays from the upper or lower third for negative and positive angles, respectively (see simulation).\n",
    "Therefore, higher-order maxima occur for $m \\approx \\pm \\frac{3}{2}, \\pm \\frac{5}{2}, ...$\n",
    "**Minima** occur if all rays destructively interfere. \n",
    "That is the case, if the path difference of the outer most rays is a multiple of the wavelength, i.e.  $m = \\pm 1, \\pm 2, ...$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize:\n",
    "* **Central maximum:** Rays passing straight through the slit are in phase, creating a central bright region at an angle $\\theta = 0$. \n",
    "* **Minima:** Minima occur at angles $\\theta$ where the path difference between rays from the top and bottom of the slit is an integer multiple of the wavelength $\\lambda$:\n",
    "    $$D \\sin\\theta = m\\lambda, \\quad m = \\pm 1, \\pm 2, ...$$\n",
    "* **Higher-order maxima:** Between the minima, weaker maxima appear approximately where the path difference is a half-integer multiple of the wavelength:\n",
    "    $$D \\sin\\theta \\approx (m + \\frac{1}{2})\\lambda, \\quad m \\approx \\pm \\frac{3}{2}, \\pm \\frac{5}{2}, ...$$\n"

    "Thus, each thin strips emits light in all direction towards the screen.\n",
    "Again, as in the simulation, we will consider only rays from the strips that are parallel to each other, i.e. have the same angle $\\theta$.\n",
    "As we consider the strips to be much thinner than the wavelength $\\lambda$, **each strip acts as a coherent source** (wave from an individual strip are in phase).\n",
    "As before, there will be a **path difference** $\\Delta = \\Delta y sin \\theta$, which we can convert into a **phase difference** $\\Delta \\beta$:\n",
    "$$\\Delta \\beta = \\frac{2 \\pi}{\\lambda} \\Delta y \\sin \\theta$$\n",

    "Under the assumption that the slit is uniformly illuminated, each strip is associated with is own electric field, each with the amplitude $\\Delta E_0$.\n",
    "While the amplitude is the same for each strip, the phase differs between the strips.\n",
    "Thus, the **electric field of each strip** has a magnitude/amplitude and a orientation/phase, i.e. **is a vector**. \n",
    "Therefore, we obtain the **intensity on the screen** as the **vector sum of all strips**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let consider the total phase difference $\\beta$ across all slits, i.e. from top to bottom slit (distance $D = N \\Delta y$):\n",

    "\n",
    "For higher order maxima, the total phase difference needs to be $\\beta=\\pm 3\\pi, \\pm 5 \\pi, ...$ as part of the vectors cancel each other (the portion that would form a circle if we attach the vectors att each others ends). \n",

    "\n",
    "The intensity of this diffraction pattern can be analyzed using the **phasor technique**. \n",

    "We can find the magnitude of this chord by considering the isosceles triangle formed by the two radii to the ends of the arc and the chord itself. \n",
    "The angle between the two radii is $\\beta$. \n",
    "We can bisect this triangle with a line that is perpendicular to the chord and passes through the center of the circle. \n",
    "This creates two right-angled triangles. \n",
    "The angle opposite to half the chord ($E_{\\theta}/2$) is $\\beta/2$, and the hypotenuse is the radius $r$. Using trigonometry, we have:\n",

    "\n",
    "In the previous chapter, we used interference to determine where the minima and maxima occur in a double-slit experiment.\n",
    "This is still valid, but in reality the pattern on the screen will not have infinite, equally bright peaks but a finite number of peaks with the brightest peak at the center and lower intensity peaks surrounding it.\n",
    "This is due to diffraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use our knowledge about the intensity at a single slit and refine it for the double-slit experiment.\n",
    "Consider a double-slit setup where each slit has a finite width $D$, and the distance between the centers of the two slits is $d$. \n",
    "We can think of this as two individual single slits, each contributing to the electric field at a point on the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "From our previous discussion, the electric field at an angle $\\theta$ due to a single slit of width $D$ can be represented by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E_{single} = E_{0, single} \\frac{\\sin(\\beta/2)}{\\beta/2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $E_{0, single}$ is the maximum electric field amplitude for the single slit (at $\\theta=0$), and $\\frac{\\beta}{2} = \\frac{\\pi D \\sin \\theta}{\\lambda}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, in a double-slit experiment, we have two such slits separated by a distance $d$. \n",
    "Let's assume that the electric field from each slit has the same amplitude as the single-slit case. \n",
    "However, due to the path difference between the light waves from the two slits reaching a point on the screen at an angle $\\theta$, there will be a phase difference between their contributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The path difference between the waves from the corresponding points in the two slits is approximately $\\Delta = d \\sin \\theta$. This path difference leads to a phase difference $\\delta$ given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\delta = \\frac{2 \\pi}{\\lambda} \\Delta = \\frac{2 \\pi}{\\lambda} d \\sin \\theta$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let the electric field from the top slit at the screen be $E_1$ and the electric field from the bottom slit be $E_2$. \n",
    "We can represent these as phasors. If we consider the phase at the midpoint between the two slits as a reference, the phase difference for each slit relative to this midpoint will be $\\pm \\delta/2$. \n",
    "Therefore, the electric fields from the two slits at the screen can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E_1 = E_{single} e^{i \\delta/2}$$\n",
    "$$E_2 = E_{single} e^{-i \\delta/2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The total electric field $E_{total}$ at the screen is the superposition of the electric fields from the two slits:\n",

    "$$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = E_{single} e^{i \\delta/2} + E_{single} e^{-i \\delta/2}$$\n",
    "$$E_{total} = E_{single} (e^{i \\delta/2} + e^{-i \\delta/2})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the trigonometric identity $e^{ix} + e^{-ix} = 2 \\cos x$, we can rewrite the expression for the total electric field as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E_{total} = 2 E_{single} \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\delta}{2}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Substituting the expression for $E_{single}$:\n",

    "$$E_{total} = 2 E_{0, single} \\frac{\\sin(\\beta/2)}{\\beta/2} \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\delta}{2}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The intensity of the light is proportional to the square of the amplitude of the total electric field. \n",
    "Let $I_0$ be the intensity when $\\theta=0$ for a single slit (proportional to $E_{0, single}^2$). \n",

    "\n",
    "We can relate this to the intensity of the central maximum of the double-slit pattern. When $\\theta=0$, $\\beta = 0$ and $\\delta = 0$, so $\\frac{\\sin(\\beta/2)}{\\beta/2} \\rightarrow 1$ and $\\cos(\\delta/2) \\rightarrow 1$. \n",
    "The intensity at the central maximum of the double-slit is four times the intensity of the central maximum of a single slit with the same width (because we have two slits contributing). \n",
    "Let $I_{0, double}$ be the intensity at the central maximum of the double-slit. \n",
    "Then $I_{0, double} \\propto (2 E_{0, single})^2$. \n",
    "We can write the intensity at any angle $\\theta$ as:\n",

    "\n",
    "If we define $I_0$ as the intensity of the central maximum of the double-slit pattern, then your formula is correct:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$I_{\\theta} = I_0 \\left( \\frac{\\sin(\\beta/2)}{\\beta/2} \\right)^2 \\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\delta}{2}\\right)$$\n",

    "$$\\theta \\approx 1.22 \\frac{\\lambda}{D}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As a consequence, the resolution of a lens, i.e. its ability to distinguish between two closely spaced objects, is limited. \n",

    "## 2.12.5 Diffraction grating &amp; spectroscopy\n",
    "\n",
    "A **diffraction grating** consists of a large number of equally spaced parallel slits (separation $d$). \n",
    "Diffraction gratings typically have a very large number of slits per unit length, often thousands of lines per centimeter or millimeter. \n",
    "It is used for precise wavelength measurements. \n",
    "This precise relationship between the angle of diffraction and the wavelength makes diffraction gratings invaluable tools in **spectroscopy**, where they are used to separate and analyze the different wavelengths present in a light source. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using our knowledge about the double-slit experiment, we see that maxima occur at angles $\\theta$ given by ($m$ as the order):\n",
    "$$\\sin\\theta = \\frac{m\\lambda}{d}, \\quad m = 0, \\pm 1, \\pm 2, ...$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Like, in the double-slit experiment, the central, zero-th order maximum is the brightest, but compared to the double-slit experiment, the grating produces sharper higher-order maxima. \n",
    "This is because if the angle $theta$ is increased even slightly beyond the angle required for a maximum, while the waves from two adjacent slits might only be slightly out of phase, waves from slits that are hundreds of slits apart can become exactly out of phase. \n",
    "This leads to destructive interference across almost all the slits, causing the intensity to drop off rapidly away from the maximum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the diffraction grating we just described is a so-called **transmission grating**. \n",
    "Another type is the **reflection grating**, which is made by ruling fine lines on a metallic or glass surface. \n",
    "Light is reflected from this surface and then analyzed. \n",
    "The fundamental principles of analysis are the same for both transmission and reflection gratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's use **white light instead of monochromatic light**.\n",
    "We will observe a sharp white peak at the center ($m=0$ order), where all wavelengths interfere constructively at the same angle ($\\theta=0$). \n",
    "However, for all other orders ($m \\neq 0$), the different wavelengths present in white light will be diffracted at different angles according to the grating equation:\n",
    "$$\\sin\\theta = \\frac{m\\lambda}{d}$$\n",
    "As a result, instead of a single sharp peak for each order, we will observe a **spectrum** of colors spread out over a certain angular width. \n",
    "This spreading of light into its component wavelengths is the fundamental principle behind using diffraction gratings in **spectroscopy**. \n",
    "Each order of diffraction will display a distinct spectrum, similar to what is observed with a prism, allowing for the analysis of the wavelengths present in the light source.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A **spectrometer** or **spectroscope** is an instrument designed for the precise measurement of wavelengths of light. \n",
    "It achieves this by separating the different wavelengths present in a light source using a diffraction grating or a prism. \n",
    "Light from the source first enters the spectrometer through a narrow slit in the **collimator**. \n",
    "This slit is positioned at the focal point of a lens, which then produces a parallel beam of light directed towards the diffraction grating or prism. \n",
    "A movable telescope is used to focus the light after it has been separated into its constituent wavelengths by the grating or prism. \n",
    "By carefully positioning the telescope to observe a diffraction peak (typically the first order) corresponding to a specific wavelength emitted by the source, and accurately measuring the angle $\\theta$ of this peak, the wavelength $\\lambda$ can be calculated using the grating equation:\n",
    "$$\\lambda = \\frac{d}{m}\\sin \\theta$$\n",
    "where $m$ represents the order of diffraction and $d$ is the spacing between the slits of the grating. \n",
    "The observed bright line for a particular wavelength is actually an image of the entrance slit. \n",
    "While a narrower slit enhances the precision of angular measurements, it also reduces the intensity of the light. \n",
    "When the incoming light contains a continuous range of wavelengths, a **continuous spectrum** is observed in the spectroscope.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spectrometers commonly use either a transmission grating or a reflection grating to separate light. Alternatively, some spectrometers utilize a prism.\n",
    "Prisms work based on the principle of **dispersion**, where different wavelengths of light are refracted (bent) at different angles. \n",
    "Unlike diffraction gratings, where the relationship between the diffraction angle and wavelength is linear, the dispersion of a prism is non-linear and therefore requires calibration for accurate wavelength determination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spectroscopy, the technique of using spectrometers, has a crucial application in identifying the composition of substances at the atomic and molecular level. \n",
    "When a gas is heated or subjected to an electric current, it emits light at specific, discrete wavelengths, forming a unique **line spectrum**. \n",
    "These emitted wavelengths act as a fingerprint for the particular element or compound. \n",
    "Line spectra are characteristic of gases under conditions of high temperature and low pressure or density. \n",
    "In contrast, heated solid objects, like the filament of a lightbulb, and dense gaseous objects such as the Sun, produce a **continuous spectrum** encompassing a broad range of wavelengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, the continuous spectrum of the Sun is not perfectly uniform but contains a multitude of dark lines known as **absorption lines**. \n",
    "These lines occur because atoms and molecules can absorb light at the very same specific wavelengths that they are capable of emitting. \n",
    "The absorption lines in the Sun's spectrum are primarily caused by the absorption of light by atoms and molecules in the cooler outer layers of the Sun's atmosphere, as well as by components of the Earth's atmosphere. \n",
    "Through meticulous analysis of these absorption lines, scientists have been able to identify the presence of at least two-thirds of all known elements in the Sun. \n",
    "Spectroscopy is also an indispensable tool for determining the elemental composition of the atmospheres of planets, interstellar space, and distant stars."
